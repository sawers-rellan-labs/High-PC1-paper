## Summary
After domestication in the tropical lowlands of México, maize expanded throughout the Americas and adapted to very diverse environments. 
Because of its rich evolutionary history, maize is an ideal species to study convergent evolution. 
Here, we use multiple highland adapted populations to study how phosphatidylcholine metabolism helped maize adapt to new environments. 
We show that an introgression from teosinte *mexicana* *High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1)* into maize lead to an increase in phosphatidylcholine levels that improved maize fitness probably through an effect on flowering time.  
*HPC1* is a good example of what could be many genes to be characterized in the *mexicana* introgression that may help maize adapt to stressful growing conditions similar to those found at high elevations.
