\section{Abstract}

After domestication from lowland teosinte \parv (\textit{Zea mays} ssp.\parv) in the warm Mexican southwest, maize (\textit{Zea mays} ssp. \textit{mays}) colonized the highlands of M\'exico and South America. 
In the highlands, maize was exposed to lower temperatures that imposed strong selection on flowering time.
Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature and low phosphorus availability, and have also been suggested to influence flowering time.
Here, we combined linkage mapping analysis with genome scans to identify \textit{High PhosphatidylCholine 1} (\hpc), a gene which encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. 
Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at \hpc, with the highland \hpc allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. 
The highland maize \hpc variant results in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. 
A meta-analysis indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. 
Mutagenesis of \hpc via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. 
Finally, we showed that the highland \hpc allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte \textit{Zea mays} ssp. \mex and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from the Northern US, Canada and Europe.
Thus, \hpc introgressed from teosinte \mex underlies a large metabolic QTL that modulates  phosphatidylcholine levels and has an adaptive effect at least in part via induction of early flowering time.

\subsection{Significance Statement}
Despite more than a century of genetic research, our understanding of the genetic basis of the astounding capacity of maize to adapt to new environments is still in its infancy.
Recent work in many crops has pointed to a potentially important role for introgression in underpinning adaptation, but clear examples of adaptive loci arising via this process are lacking. 
Here, we elucidate the evolutionary history of a novel, major metabolic QTL that we mapped down to a single gene, \hpc.
Alterations in highland \hpc are the result of a teosinte mexicana introgression in maize, lead to high phosphatidylcholine levels, and improve fitness via induction of early flowering. 
\section{Introduction}

%How do organisms adapt to high elevations
Elevation gradients are associated with changes in environmental factors that impose significant physiological constraints on an organism. 
Adaptation to highland environments is achieved via the selection of genetic variants that improve their ability to withstand reduced oxygen availability \cite{Natarajan2016-pc, Yi2010-se, Bigham2010-is, Liu2019-eg}, increased UV radiation \cite{Yang2017-gs} and lower temperatures \cite{Velotta2020-as, Cicconardi2020-gs}.
In particular, low temperatures can significantly reduce the thermal time accumulation to flowering, measured in growing degree days (GDDs) \cite{Gilmore1958-dx}, and select for accelerated development and maturity as a compensatory mechanism \cite{Hatfield2015-od}.
%Maize domestication and expansion
Following domestication from teosinte \parv (\textit{Zea mays} ssp. \parv) \cite{Matsuoka2002-bg,Piperno2009-fj} in the lowland, subtropical environment of the Balsas River basin (Guerrero, M\'exico), cultivated maize (\textit{Zea mays} ssp. \textit{mays}) expanded throughout M\'exico and reached the highland valleys of central M\'exico around 6,500 years before present \cite{Piperno2001-ea}.

%Contribution of mexicana to highland maize adaptation.
In M\'exico, highland adaptation of maize was aided by substantial adaptive introgression from a second subspecies of teosinte, teosinte \mex (\textit{Zea mays} ssp. \mex) that had already adapted to the highlands of M\'exico thousands of years after its divergence from teosinte \parv \cite{Hufford2013-gs, Gonzalez-Segovia2019-jy}. 
Adaptation to low temperature and soils with low phosphorus in highland environments drove \mex genetic divergence from the lowland \parv \cite{AguirreLiguori2019-fl}.
Phenotypically, the most evident signs of \mex introgression into maize are the high levels of stem pigmentation and pubescence \cite{Lauter2004-eq} that are thought to protect against high UV radiation and low temperatures. 
The ability to withstand low temperatures and efficiently photosynthesize during the early stages of seedling development are key factors in maize highland adaptation \cite{Hardacre1980-tq}.
Indeed, recent transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that the inversion \textit{Inv4m}, introgressed from \mex, strongly affects the expression of genes involved in chloroplast physiology and photosynthesis \cite{Crow2020-gene}.  
\textit{Inv4m} is also associated with earlier flowering times in highland maize \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn, Gates2019-xu}. 
Given the low accumulation of growing degree days in typical highland environments, selection has favored shorter generation  times in highland adapted maize \cite{Gates2019-xu}.
By the time maize reached the Mexican highlands, its range had already expanded far to the South, including colonization of highland environments in the  Andes \cite{Athens2016-ep, Grobman2012-pm}. 
%Andean maize adaptation occurred without \mex introgression, as there is no known wild teosinte relative in South America. 
Andean maize adaptation occurred largely independently of \mex introgression \cite{Takuno2015-uj, Wang2020-mp}, and there is no known wild teosinte relative in South America. 
These multiple events of maize adaptation to highland environments make maize a good system to study the evolutionary and physiological mechanisms of convergent adaptation. % \cite{Takuno2015-uj, Wang2020-mp}.

%Photoperiod adaptation
In comparison to its southward expansion, the northward migration of maize into the modern-day United States, where summer daylengths are longer, occurred at a much slower pace \cite{Da_Fonseca2015-zh, Swarts2017-ge} due to delayed flowering of photoperiod-sensitive tropical maize lines \cite{Hung2012-ms}.
Indeed, a host of evidence suggests that maize cultivation in northern latitudes was enabled by the selection of allelic variants that led to a reduction in photoperiod sensitivity to allow flowering under longer photoperiods \cite{Liang2018-af, Guo2018-on, Coles2010-db, Huang2018-ga, Yang2013-lg, Salvi2007-ku, Hung2012-ms}.
Some of the early flowering alleles that conferred an adaptive advantage in highland environments are the result of \mex introgressions into highland maize \cite{Guo2018-on}.
Maize first entered into the US via the Mexican highlands \cite{Da_Fonseca2015-zh}, and these early flowering alleles show further evidence of selection in northern lattitudes \cite{Guo2018-on}, consistent with a likely role for \mex introgression in maize adaptation to shorter daylengths. 
When introduced into Northern Europe, photoperiod-insensitive maize from the Northern US and Canada thrived as it was already pre-adapted to northern latitudes and lower temperatures \cite{Brandenburg2017-ii}.
The genetic, physiological and phenotypic evidence of these adaptations, however, is quite limited.

Plant phospholipids, as well as other glycerolipids such as sulfolipids, galactolipids and non polar lipids such as triacylglycerols, are involved in plant responses to low temperature.
Phospholipid levels are increased in plants exposed to low temperatures \cite{Degenkolbe2012-wf} and levels of unsaturated fatty acids in glycerolipids are reduced \cite{Welti2002-uk, Lynch1987-ln}, which may help maintain the fluidity of cell membranes.
Under stressful conditions, the proportions of differently shaped lipids in plants are modulated to maintain membrane flexibility while preventing membrane leakage. 
For instance, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are rectangular polar lipids that are well suited for the formation of bilayer membranes because the size of their glycerol backbone, choline headgroup and fatty acid tails are similar.
By contrast, lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a triangular PC with a single acyl group that cannot form a bilayer because its headgroup is much larger than its fatty acid \cite{Jouhet2013-fv}.
LPCs do allow for some membrane movement, but high LPC concentrations act as a detergent \cite{Henriksen2010-cm} and can facilitate cell leakage and damage at low temperatures, effects that would be prevented by higher PC levels.
In cold-adapted maize temperate lines and \textit{Tripsacum} species (a distant maize relative), genes involved in  phospholipid biosynthesis show accelerated rates of protein sequence evolution, further supporting an important role for phospholipid metabolism across several species during cold adaptation \cite{Yan2019-tx}. 
Finally, certain species of PC, the most abundant phospholipid  in plant cells \cite{Gu2017-nd}, can bind to \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and accelerate flowering through an unknown mechanism \cite{Nakamura2014-qf}. 
Consistent with this observation, glycerolipid levels in maize have predictive power for flowering time \cite{Riedelsheimer2013-bd}. 

Here, we identified an adaptive teosinte \mex introgression that alters highland maize phospholipid metabolism and leads to early flowering.
Using genome scans and linkage mapping, we identified \textit{High PhosphatidylCholine1} (\hpc), a gene encoding a phospholipase A1, as a driver of high PC levels in highland maize. 
Data from thousands of genotyped landrace test-crosses grown in common garden experiments at different elevations in M\'exico showed a strong genotype-by-environment effect at the \hpc locus, where the highland allele leads to higher fitness in the highlands and reduced fitness at lower elevations.
Furthermore, we determined that the highland \hpc allele, that was introgressed from teosinte \mex, was carried northward and is now present in maize cultivars grown in the Northern US and European Flint lines.
These results suggest that the \hpc highland allele has a beneficial effect in cold, high-latitude environments, where early flowering is advantageous.

\subsection{Highland Mesoamerican  show high PC/LPC ratios and selection of highly unsaturated PCs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Knowing that lipids play an important role in adaptation to adverse environments, we quantified the glycerolipids of 120 highland and lowland landraces\footnote[1]{Open pollinated varieties that have been selected for specific uses and environments by smallholder farmers and they are characterized by similar morphotypes. Landraces typically show as much diversity within individuals from the same landrace group than between groups.} from Mesoamerica and South America (\cref{Fig1}A-B, Sup. File 1). 
This  diversity panel, hereafter referred to as the HiLo diversity panel, was grown in highland (2650 masl) and lowland (20 masl) common garden experiments in Mexico.
After comparing many different glycerolipids and the relevant ratios for key lipid biosynthesis enzymes, we observed that Mesoamerican highland landraces have high PC/LPC ratios, particularly when grown in the highlands (\cref{Fig1}A-B).

\label{Fig1}
\end{figure*}

The differences observed in phospholipid levels between highland and lowland maize may be the result of adaptive natural selection or random genetic drift during the process of maize colonization of highland environments.
To distinguish between these two competing possibilities, we compared the variance of each phenotype across the population with the genetic variance of neutral markers, using a $Q_{ST}$-$F_{ST}$ comparison \cite{Leinonen2013-ic}.
We calculated $Q_{ST}$-$F_{ST}$ using DartSeq genotypes \cite{Janzen2021-lz} from the same plants that were used to analyze glycerolipid levels, and calculated the $Q_{ST}$-$F_{ST}$ values for each glycerolipid species for highland/lowland populations from each continent. 
Mean $Q_{ST}$ was greater than mean $F_{ST}$ in Mesoamerican and South American comparisons, although only the Mesoamerican comparison was significant (two-tailed \textit{t}-test, $p$ = 0.00073; South American comparison $p$ = 0.12).
We identified PC and LPC species with higher $Q_{ST}$ values than the neutral $F_{ST}$ in both continents  (\cref{Fig1}C-D).
The species with the highest $Q_{ST}$ value included long chain PCs with more than one unsaturation such as PC-38:5, PC-36:5 and PC-35:2.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Genes involved in PC/LPC conversion show strong highland selection signals} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We selected a set of 597 maize glycerolipid genes from their functional annotations (See Materials and Methods). 
We used the set to identify selection signals using the Population Branch Excess (PBE) \cite{Pool2017-oa} statistic across four highland populations: Southwestern US (SWUS), Mexican highlands (MH), Guatemalan highlands (GH) and Andes (AN) (\cref{Fig1}E) \cite{Wang2020-mp}. 
We identified a significant excess of genes that are targets of selection in more than two populations ($ p< 3 \times 10^{5}$, \ref{Fig1}F).
The most over-represented intersection of selected glycerolipid genes was between SWUS, MH and GH populations ($p = 1  \times 10 ^{-15} $, \cref{Fig1}F), suggesting either genes specifically selected in this geographical region relative to Andean accessions, and/or closer kinship between those populations and thus weaker statistical independence.
From all the annotated glycerolipid genes, 23 were consistently PBE outliers across all four highland populations ($p =<1  \times  ^{-10}$, \cref{Fig1}F).
We then assigned a PBE value to each of the 30 glycerolipid metabolism pathways (using a 10 kb window around each constituent gene)  and compared their average with a genomewide random sampling distribution of PBE values within genic regions. 
From these, we found that 'phospholipid remodeling' and 'PC acyl editing' had significantly higher PBE values in all four populations, indicating a possible role for phospholipid remodeling in maize highland adaptation
(\cref{Fig1}G).

\label{Fig2}
\end{figure*}

There are two possible explanations for the extent of convergent selection in highland populations (see \cite{Wang2020-mp, yeaman2018}). 
Adaptation may be conferred by a small number of genes, thereby imposing a \textit{physiological} constraint on the sources of adaptation leading to convergence. 
Alternatively, adaptation may be the result of many genes, but deleterious \textit{pleiotropic} effects restrict the number of genes that can be targeted by selection, also leading to convergence.  
Using Yeaman's \textit{et al.} $C_{hyper}$ statistic \cite{yeaman2018}, which quantifies these two modes of convergent adaptation, we determined that the overlap among putative adaptive genes in the four highland populations cannot be explained merely by physiological constraints ($C_{hyper} = 3.96$, Supplementary Table 1). 
A certain degree of pleiotropic constraint is therefore likely.
Overlap between adaptation candidates was higher for the SWUS, MH and GH population pairs ($C_{hyper} = 4.79$) than between the Andean and SWUS, MH and GH pairs ($C_{hyper} = 3.14$).

To further understand selection at a gene level, we used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) data from 2,700 Mexican maize landraces, generated by the SeeD project \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn, Gates2019-xu}, to run a \textit{pcadapt} \cite{Luu2017-ws} analysis to determine how loci might contribute to observed patterns of differentiation along major principal components of genetic variation. 
The first \textit{pcadapt} principal component separated Mexican landraces based on the elevation of their geographical origin (\cref{Fig2}B).
Using this first principal component, we identified outlier SNPs across the genome that are significantly associated with genetic variation along elevation and potentially involved in local adaptation (\cref{Fig2}A).
From the list of $\approx 600$ maize glycerolipid-related genes, 85 contained SNPs that were \textit{pcadapt} outliers for association with genetic PC1 (top 5\% $-log_{10}(P)$), and 8 of them were also PBE outliers for Mexican highlands (\cref{Fig2}A, Supplementary table 2, Sup. File 2). 
These 8 selection candidates, supported by two different sources of evidence, include two genes coding for putative enzymes whose orthologs are known to directly catalyze PC/LPC interconversion reactions. 
The first of these, \textit{Zm00001d039542}, with a $-log_{10}(P)$ of $110.28$, is  a putative phospholipase A1 that we name \textit{High PhosphatidylCholine 1}, \hpc.
The second gene, \textit{Zm00001d017584}, with a $-log_{10}(P)$ of $99.31$, is  a predicted \textit{Lyso-Phosphatidylcholine Acyl Transferase 1} that we will refer as \textit{ZmLPCAT1}. (\cref{Fig2}C). 
Although these two kinds of enzymes catalyze broadly opposite reactions, degradation vs synthesis of PC, they are unlikely to catalyze strictly reverse reactions in the Lands cycle. 
This is because A1 phopholipases attack the phosphatidylcholine at the \textit{sn-1} carbon, while LPC acyl transferases usually acylate \textit{sn-2} \cite{wang2012,richmond2011}.
Instead, plant PLA1 enzymes -like \hpc- are better known for their role in the first step of the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid \cite{wang2018b, Ishiguro2001-ob}.

\label{Fig3}

\end{figure*}

Both genes showed strong elevation-dependent allele frequency changes (\cref{Fig2}D) in  Mexican landraces.
This is expected from the \textit{pcadapt} association, and the population branch excess observed between highlands and lowlands, which include outlier SNPs within the coding sequences. 
Additionally \hpc is a PBE outlier for the three northern populations (US, MH, GH) and displayed particularly high PBE values in the Mexican highlands, having different outlier SNPs in different populations. \jri{this suggests standing variation!}
However \hpc it is not an outlier for branch excess between the Andes and the South American lowlands.
In contrast \textit{ZmLPCAT1} is indeed a PBE outlier for all 4 populations which might indicate  parallel/convergent selection for this gene between Mesoamerica and the Andes.
Even so, both \hpc and \textit{ZmLPCAT1} are annotated as part of pathways that showed outlier PBE values in all highland populations for ‘phospholipid remodelling’ and ‘PC acyl editing’. (Fig.\cref{Fig1}F, Sup. File 2). 
Taken together, these two independent population genetic approaches show that pathways involved in phospholipid remodelling,  including genes controlling the PC/LPC ratio like \hpc and \textit{ZmLPCAT1}, show strong selection signals in highland maize. 
These results show that selection on phospholipid metabolite level (\cref{Fig1}B-D) is supported at the gene level by outlier PBE and PCA \textit{pcadapt} values in genes controlling phospholipid synthesis and degradation.

\subsection{A major QTL explaining PC to LPC conversion overlaps \hpc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To further characterize the genetic architecture of phospholipid biosynthesis in highland maize, we developed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) BC1S5 population derived from a cross between the temperate inbred line B73 and the Mexican highland landrace Palomero Toluqueño (PT), using B73 as the recurrent parent (75\% B73, 25\% PT) \cite{Perez-Limon2022-lg}.

The parental PT accession is a popcorn landrace (palomero means popcorn in Spanish) from the Toluca Valley in M\'exico (\textit{Mexi5} CIMMYTMA 2233) (\cref{Fig3}A). 
We grew the HiLo diversity panel and the B73 x PT BC1S5 mapping population in the same highland and lowland common gardens and collected samples for glycerolipid analysis.
The locally adapted PT landrace showed higher fitness than B73 in the highland field (\cref{Fig3}A), probably due to adaptation to low temperatures in this highland environment.  
In the Mexican highlands, 5 growing degree days (GDDs) per day are typical, while 15-20 GDD/day are common in lowland environments.

We detected major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the sum of LPC species levels, PC species levels and the PC/LPC ratio that all mapped to the same locus on chromosome 3, at around 8.5 Mb (\cref{Fig3}B). 
We searched for evidence of epistatic interactions for LPC levels, PC levels, and the PC/LPC ratio through a combination of R/qtl \code{scantwo} and \code{stepwise} functions \cite{Broman2003-ac}.
The three QTLs \textit{qLPCs3@8.5}, \textit{qPCs3@8.5} and \textit{qPCs/LPCs3@8.5} were robust against environmental effects and were detected in both the highland and lowland environments.
The additive effect of the PT allele at these QTLs was associated with high levels of PCs, low levels of LPCs and consequently high PC/LPC ratios, while the B73 allele had the opposite effect (\cref{Fig3}C, top panel).
Individual PC and LPC species QTLs  at this locus \cref{figure:Sup:QTL_effect_sp} showed the same additive effect for the PT allele as the sum of each class (PCs, LPCs and PCs/LPCs) of species (\cref{Fig3}C, top panel. 
All individual LPC QTLs at the \textit{qLPCs3@8.5} locus corresponded to LPCs that contain at least one double bond in their fatty acid (\cref{figure:Sup:QTL_effect_sp}, Sup. file 3).
\textit{qPCs3@8.5} was driven mainly by PC species with more than two fatty acid double bonds, such as PC 36:5 (\cref{Fig3}D and \cref{figure:Sup:QTL_effect_sp} A-D, Supplementary file 3).
We then sought to identify candidate genes underlying the QTLs on chromosome 3.
The PC/LPC ratio QTL had the highest significance, LOD 24.5, and explained the most phenotypic variance (87\%). 
The QTL contained 72 genes within its 1.5 LOD drop confidence interval (7.9-10 Mb). 
We hypothesized that the metabolic phenotypes we observed might be due to a gene involved in the process of PC-LPC conversion.  
The maize genome encodes 75 putative phospholipases (\cref{figure::Sup:HPC1_misc}A), of which half are predicted to be phospholipase A1-type (PLA1) (\cref{figure::Sup:HPC1_misc}B).  
We identified \hpc (position on chromosome 3: 8,542,107 bp to 8,544,078 bp), within the QTL peak, as the most likely candidate (\cref{Fig3}B). 
HPC1 has a predicted phospholipase A1-Igamma1 activity and can be classified, based on its two closest Arabidopsis orthologs (encoded by At1g06800 and At2g30550), as a PC-hydrolyzing PLA1 Class I phospholipase \cite{Ryu2004-iv}. 
PLA1-type phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids in the sn-1 position and produce a lyso-phospholipid and a free fatty acid (\cref{figure::Sup:HPC1_misc}B). 
In B73, \hpc was one of the most highly expressed phospholipases, with expression almost exclusively restricted to vegetative leaves (V4-V9) (\cref{figure:Sup:B73_expression}A) \cite{Stelpflug2016-vr}, which is the biological material we sampled for glycerolipid analysis. 
In B73 leaves, \hpc was also the most highly expressed gene in the QTL interval (\cref{figure::Sup:HPC1_misc}C \cite{Stelpflug2016-vr}).
Class I phospholipases are targeted to the chloroplast; indeed, we identified a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) at the beginning of the predicted HPC1 sequence using the online tool ChloroP \cite{Emanuelsson1999-rs}.
We validated the chloroplast localization of HPC1 by transiently expressing  the HPC1 CTP fragment fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in \textit{Nicotiana benthamiana} leaves (\cref{figure:Sup:HPC1_organelle}).

The effect of \hpc on the PC/LPC levels may be caused by mis-regulation of \hpc expression in highland landraces and/or by a mutation affecting the enzymatic activity of HPC1 protein. 
To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed \hpc expression in B73, PT and the corresponding F\textsubscript{1} hybrid plants grown at high or low temperatures to simulate highland and lowland conditions, respectively (\cref{Fig3}E). 
Under cold conditions, \textit{HPC1-B73} was up-regulated, but \textit{HPC1-PT} was not (\cref{Fig3}E). 
The lack of up-regulation in cold conditions of \hpc may explain the high PC/LPC levels in PT.
However, the gene is expressed in PT at the same levels as in B73 under control conditions.
In the F\textsubscript{1} hybrids, \hpc expression was consistent with a dominant B73 effect.
We also observed a dominant B73 effect at the metabolic level when we analyzed B73 x PT RILs that were heterozygous in the \hpc locus
(\cref{figure::Sup:HPC1_misc}D).
Variation in \hpc may also affect enzymatic activity of the HPC1-PT variant. 
To test this hypothesis we sequenced three B73 x PT RILs (B021, B042, B122) that are homozygous for the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele.
We discovered a recombination point 500 bp upstream of the \hpc translation start codon (\cref{Fig3}F, \cref{figure:Sup:hpc1_promoter}) in RIL B042, resulting in a chimeric gene with the coding region from PT, and a promoter segment from B73.
PC/LPC levels in RIL B042 were similar to other RILs that are homozygous for the PT haplotype at the 8.54 Mb marker at the QTL peak (\cref{Fig3}F). 
This result supports the hypothesis that the metabolic effect we see in the B73 x PT RILs is likely due to an impaired function of the HPC1-PT enzyme rather than to changes in the \textit{HPC1-PT} regulatory region.
However, in RIL B042 regulatory variants in the first 500 bp of the promoter could also impact expression levels.

If \hpc is the underlying causal gene of this QTL, the observed metabolic phenotypes would be consistent with reduced or loss of function of the HPC1-PT enzyme leading to higher levels of PCs and lower levels of LPCs in the PT background. 
To test this hypothesis we generated a CRISPR \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} mutant (\cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}A) in the B104 inbred, a temperate stiff stalk inbred derived from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic population like B73. 
We identified two transgenic events, hereafter designated \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR T ins}} and \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR T del}} (\cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}A).
We then measured PC and LPC species in wild-type and mutant plants grown under long day conditions.  
The phospholipid profiles of the \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} plants 
replicated those of the \textit{PT} allele in the RILs (\cref{Fig3} C-D bottom panels and \cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}B), further confirming that the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele impairs HPC1 function and thus underlies the QTL on chromosome 3 at around 8.5 Mb. 
Lastly, we generated cell-free protein of both the HPC1-B73 and HPC1-PT alleles and incubated them with various phospholipid substrates. 
We measured the amount of phospholipid substrate and lyso-phospholipid product for each compound (\cref{figure:Sup:MS_spectra}). 
This data confirmed that both versions of HPC1 have PLA1 activity and suggested that HPC1-B73 may have higher activity on substrates like PC36:4 that show stark differences in abundance between highland and lowland lines, as well as \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} lines.
Together, the RIL and CRISPR results showed that \hpc underlies a major metabolic QTL explaining PC/LPC ratio. 
A mutation in the flap-lid domain of HPC1 affecting substrate accessibility probably leads to impaired function in the highland PT allele.

\subsection{Identification of the putative causal SNP in \hpc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We Sanger sequenced the \hpc locus from several RILs harboring the PT haplotype at \hpc and identified several non-synonymous SNPs within the coding sequence that might influence HPC1 function (\cref{figure:Sup:aa_alilnment}).

We focused our attention on SNP 631 in the flap lid domain, which leads to a conservative replacement of isoleucine for valine (V211I, \cref{Fig4}A).  
The flap lid domain is important for phospholipase activity and is located in a lipase class 3 domain (PFAM domain PF01764) that is highly conserved across the tree of life \cite{Jensen2021-zm}. 
We recovered 982 observations of the lipase class 3 PFAM domain from 719 prokaryotic species using PfamScan \cite{Potter2018-tk, El-Gebali2019-pw}, and estimated optimal growth temperatures from their tRNA sequences \cite{Cimen2020-dm}.
We then tested whether genetic variation in the lipase class 3 domain was significantly associated with optimal growth temperature in bacteria \cite{Jensen2021-iv}. 
We identified several significant associations, all of which were located in the flap lid region (\cref{Fig4}A, bold letters).  
Notably, the presence of a valine at residue 211, as observed in the PT allele, was associated with lower bacterial optimal growth temperatures relative to bacterial lipases that harbor the isoleucine residue observed in B73 (\cref{Fig4}B), suggesting that the PT allele may be better adapted to the low temperatures to which highland maize is exposed.

\cref{Fig4}C shows the top I-TASSER model (plum) for the putative phospholipase encoded by \textit{HPC1-B73}, overlaid on chain B of the crystal structure of phospholipase A1 from \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} (PDB 2YIJ, tan). 
Residues that differ between the PT and B73 HPC1 are shown in yellow. 
The catalytic triad and H400 identified from CDD conservation analysis are also labeled.
However, our models put H416 in the catalytic triad instead of H400. 
Of the residues that differ between PT and B73 HPC1, residues 211, 448, and 449 are the closest to the catalytic triad. 
I211 is positioned on the N-terminal end of the flap lid domain and is well suited to stabilize, through hydrophobic interactions, binding of a lipid substrate.
Replacement of I211 with V211 results in the loss of a methyl group and may influence the strength of these hydrophobic interactions, influencing substrate binding and/or the dynamics of the flap lid domain.
These results strongly point to the mutation in the flap lid domain as the most probably underlying mutation affecting HPC1 activity.

\subsection{\hpc shows strong elevation-dependent antagonistic pleiotropy in Mexican landrace fitness phenotypes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our selection and QTL analysis show strong evidence that \hpc in under selection in highland maize and that it's a major QTL controlling phospholipid metabolism. 
To evaluate the possible fitness effects of HPC1 variation in locally adapted landraces across M\'exico we re-analyzed phenotypic data from a previously reported F1 association mapping panel \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn, Gates2019-xu} composed of around 2,000 landrace F1s grown in 23 common garden environments across an elevation gradient.  
We then fitted a model to estimate the effect of variation at \textit{HPC1-PT} on the relationship between fitness traits and elevation \cite{Runcie2019-Gr}.
\hpc was a clear outlier in GWAS of genotype-by-elevation of fitness traits like flowering time yield (\cref{figure:Sup:GxE_scan}A-B) showing that elevation dependent variation of \hpc not only has an effect on phospholipid levels but also has strong effect on fitness traits.
Indeed variation at \hpc showed significant genotype $\times$ elevation effects for several fitness traits (\cref{Fig5}A). 
The effect of \hpc on flowering time showed antagonistic pleiotropy between highland and lowland environments (\cref{Fig5}A). 
The highland \textit{HPC1-PT} allele was associated with delayed flowering in lowlands, an increase of around one day in days to anthesis (DTA), and with accelerated flowering at high elevation (with a decrease of DTA of almost one day, \cref{Fig5}A).
Variation at \hpc showed conditional neutrality on fresh ear weight and grain weight per hectare traits: the highland allele had no effect in lowland environments, but was associated with greater values in highland environments (\cref{Fig5}A).
Additionally we checked for previous reports of HPC1 associations with flowering time in other populations through the MaizeGDB \cite{Woodhouse2021-wd} genome browser. 
Here we found a significant flowering time SNP in the \texit{HPC1} CDS (\cref{Fig5}B) for the Nested Association Mapping population \cite{Wallace2014-yy}. 
This flowering time additive locus is only 6 bp from the foca SNP we we used to text  $G \times E$ at \hpc in the SEEDs panel \cref{Fig4}. 
Variation at this SNP correlates with a reduction in flowering time of 8.5 hours, relative to B73, and explains 1.12\% of the trait variance, about one third of the the highest effect size for flowering time in the NAM population. 

We then used genetic markers data from the HapMap 3 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng} to analyze the linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the HPC1 region (\cref{Fig4}B).
We found a strong LD block of around 150 bp in the CDS of the gene which includes the focal SNP used for the analysis in \cref{Fig5}B and the  NAM GWAS hit \cref{Fig5}A. 
We found another LD block that covers the 5' region of \hpc and the promoter region 2 kb upstream of \hpc (\cref{Fig5}B). 
Interestingly, this second LD block on the promoter overlaps with two strong ATAC-Seq peaks identified in B73 (\cite{Ricci2019-zj}, \cref{Fig5}B).
These results confirm that the SNPs associated with fitness traits like flowering time on the \texit{HPC1} CDS are not linked with other SNPs outside the \texit{HPC1} CDS.
However in the SEEDs dataset there are no GBS markers for several kb upstream of \hpc so a possible second regulatory variant in the promoter (\cref{Fig4}B) could still have an effect on \hpc expression. We then further evaluated the effect of \hpc using both \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} mutants on flowering in Raleigh, NC. 
Although the mutants showed high PC/LPC ratio mutant phenotypes, no significant difference in flowering time was observed (\cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}C).

\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This lack of differences on flowering time might be due to the strong G x E effect of \hpc (\cref{Fig4}A) and that Raleigh's environmental conditions may not enable the manifestation of the flowering time phenotype.
In summary, SNPs within a short LD block in the lipase domain of the \texit{HPC1} CDS show strong Genotype x Elevation fitness effects in Mexican landraces evaluated across an altitudinal gradient in M\'exico and in the NAM and support that phospholipid changes induced by \hpc have physiological effects that may explain the strong selection of \hpc in highland environments.

\subsection{\textit{HPC1-PT} was introgressed from teosinte \mex and is conserved in Flint inbred lines}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We next explored the segregation of the SNP causing the V211I change among other highland maize varieties.
We detected the PT allele at high frequencies in highland landraces from M\'exico and Guatemala. 
In addition, the PT allele segregated in Southwestern US landraces. 
The B73 allele was fixed in lowland Mexican, South American and Andean landraces (\cref{Fig6}A). 
These results are consistent with our previous PBE results (\cref{Fig2}F).
The PT allele was also present in teosinte, in one fourth of all teosinte \parv accessions tested and in both \mex accessions reported in Hapmap 3 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng} (\cref{Fig6}A). 
This observation prompted us to examine whether the PT allele was the result of post-domestication introgression from teosinte \mex during maize highland colonization, or whether it was selected from \parv standing variation.
To test for introgression from \mex, we used \(f_d\) data from \cite{Gonzalez-Segovia2019-jy} and established that the genomic region containing \hpc shows signatures of introgression from \mex into highland maize (\cref{Fig6}B).
We then performed a haplotype network analysis using SNP data from the \hpc coding region of 1,160 Mexican accessions from the SeeD Dataset \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn} that were homozygous for all SNPS across the coding region and the teosinte inbred lines (TIL) from Hapmap 3 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng}.   
We identified nine haplotype groups that cluster mainly based on elevation (\cref{Fig6}C). 
The two major groups, II and VI, contained mainly lowland and highland landraces, respectively. 
The two \mex teosinte inbred lines (TIL08 and 25) belonged to group IV  (\cref{Fig6}C) together with highland landraces primarily collected in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (30/36 from the highlands of Jalisco, Michoacán, M\'exico, Puebla and Veracruz).
We then examined whether this \mex haplotype (denoted \textit{ZxHPC1}) that is introgressed into Mesoamerican highland maize was also present in modern maize inbred lines. 

We performed a neighbor-joining cluster analysis using Hapmap 3 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng} inbred lines including those from the 282 inbred panel, Teosinte inbred lines, German lines and PT. 
We identified two main groups, one containing the \textit{HPC1-PT} haplotype and the other containing the \textit{HPC1-B73} haplotype.
PT and the teosinte \mex inbred lines TIL-08 and TIL-25 clustered together with Northern European Flint inbred lines such as EP1, UH008, and UH009 (\cref{Fig6}D). 
Other Northern US flints, e.g., CM7, are also closely related to the \mex \textit{ZxHPC1} haplotype. 
These data suggest that after introgression into highland maize, the \textit{ZxHPC1} haplotype was maintained in Flint materials adapted to cold environments in the Northern US, Canada and Europe. 
We then used a large gene expression dataset obtained from the 282 maize diversity panel that was sampled across several developmental stages \cite{Kremling2018-gn}, and phenotypic datasets collected from the same panel grown in long days and short days.
Interestingly, \hpc expression was highly correlated with flowering time in in both long and short days. 
Lines carrying the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele were characterized by lower \hpc expression and earlier flowering times relative to lines carrying the \textit{HPC1-B73} allele (\cref{Fig6}E).
Taken together, these data show that \hpc was introgressed from teosinte \mex into highland maize and that this introgression was carried over into high latitude adapted modern inbred lines that show low \hpc expression in association with early flowering.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\textit{HPC1/Phosphatidylcholine interactions with maize flowering time protein ZCN8}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Using the same expression dataset from the 282 panel \cite{Kremling2018-gn}, we discovered that \hpc and \textit{ZmLPCAT1} expression levels are inversely correlated in most tissues (\cref{figure:Sup:cor_heatmap}), further supporting the idea that these two enzymes are coordinately regulated.
There were significant associations between \hpc expression levels in aerial tissues and several flowering time traits (\cref{figure:Sup:cor_heatmap})
The magnitude of these associations was similar to those seen for other well-characterized flowering time genes (\cref{figure:Sup:cor_heatmap}) such as \textit{ZEA CENTRORADIALIS8} (\textit{ZCN8})  and the AP2/ERF transcription factor gene \textit{ZmRAP2.7}.  
In Arabidopsis, the flowering protein Florigen (FT) has recently been shown to interact with both PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) depending on temperature and cellular location of FT \cite{Nakamura2014-qf, Susila2021-dz}.
ZCN8 is a homolog of FT, thus, it could mediate the shortened flowering time of highland maize. 
Recent work improved the crystal structure of FT, so we modeled ZCN8 against this new structure and compared the PC binding sites (\cref{figure:Sup:Docking}A,B) \cite{Nakamura2019-ht}. 
Using AutoDock Vina to simulate docking, we were able to identify sites 2 and 4 and 1 and 4 as potential binding sites of PC34:2 and PC36:2 with site 4 heavily favored in both cases (\cref{figure:Sup:Docking}A-C).
Maize ZCN8 and  Arabidopsis FT also show conservation in these sites (\cref{figure:Sup:Docking}D). 
We next heterologously expressed tagged ZCN8 in yeast and purified it in an effort to test this \textit{in vivo}. 
From our purified protein, we extracted lipids and analyzed them following the same lipidomics pipeline used for maize lipids. 
We identified PC34:2 in the purified ZCN8 protein in all of our samples confirming experimentally that ZCN8 effectively bind PC species (\cref{figure:Sup:ZCN8-PC}).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Understanding the genetic, molecular and  physiological basis of crop adaptation to different environments and the role that wild relatives have played in these processes is relevant for the identification of favorable genetic variation that can be used to improve modern crops.
The repeated events of maize adaptation to highland environments constitute an excellent natural experiment to study crop local adaptation. 
Recent studies \cite{Wang2020-mp, Takuno2015-uj, Crow2020-gene} have helped expand our understanding of the genetic basis underlying maize highland adaptation. 
However, the molecular, physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying maize highland adaptation and the possible role of highland maize traits in modern, commercial varieties remain largely unknown.
Phospholipids are key structural components of plant membranes that also function as signaling molecules during adaptation to stresses that would be prevalent in highland environments \cite{Ryu2004-iv, Nakamura2017-vb} such as low phosphorus availability \cite{Veneklaas2012-ls, Cruz-Ramirez2004-ib, Lambers2012-an} and low temperatures \cite{Degenkolbe2012-wf, Welti2002-uk, Marla2017-ph}. 
In Arabidopsis and rice, phospholipids species regulate flowering time via interactions with \textit{Arabidopsis} FT and rice Hd3a, respectively \cite{Nakamura2014-qf, Susila2021-dz, Qu2021-wc}. 
Flowering time is a major driver of maize adaptation to highland environments \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn, Gates2019-xu, Mercer2019-vj} and to northern latitudes \cite{Hung2012-ms, Swarts2017-ge}.
We used genomic scans and linkage mapping analysis to identify and clone \textit{High PhosphatidylCholine 1} (\hpc), which encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme that plays a major role in determining phosphatidylcholine levels in highland maize landraces.
We described how genetic variation at \hpc showed strong antagonistic pleiotropy  genotype-by-elevation effects on several fitness traits and underlies a flowering time QTL with significant effect sizes.
We then showed that the highland allele is the result of an introgression from teosinte \mex that has been maintained in modern maize inbred lines adapted to high latitudes.
Genes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of phospholipids were repeatedly selected in several highland maize populations of North America, Central America and South America (Figures \cref{Fig1} and \cref{Fig2}). 
\textit{ZmLPCAT1} and \hpc were two of the genes that showed the strongest, repeated signals of selection, as measured by PBE and \textit{pcadapt} in highland populations (\cref{Fig2}). 
In a previous study, \textit{ZmLPCAT1} exhibited high \textit{Fst} values when highland and lowland landraces were compared \cite{Takuno2015-uj}.
The predicted function of ZmLPCAT1 is to synthesize PC species via the acylation of LPC species, while HPC1 is predicted to hydrolyze PCs into LPCs and free fatty acids by cleaving the sn1-position.
\hpc and \textit{ZmLPCAT1} are highly expressed in B73. 
In temperate inbred lines grown \hpc is upregulated while \textit{ZmLPCAT1} is down-regulated by cold stress (\cref{figure:Sup:B73_expression}B-C) \cite{Waters2017-nat}.
These expression patterns are in agreement with the high low PC/LPC ratios that we observe in our experiments. 
Furthermore, in our experiments, \hpc was up-regulated in B73 and the B73 x PT F\textsubscript{1} hybrids after cold exposure. By contrast, the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele was expressed at similar levels as \textit{HPC1-B73} in control conditions, and was not up-regulated in cold conditions (\cref{Fig3}E).
Selection at these two loci is likely to have driven the high PC/LPC ratio we observed in highland Mexican landraces (\cref{Fig1}). 

Our QTL analysis of the PC/LPC ratios in a B73 x PT mapping population and in the \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} mutants demonstrate that the highland \textit{HPC1-PT} allele results in an enzyme with impaired function that alters highland Mexican maize PC metabolism, leading to higher PC/LPC ratios (\cref{Fig3}, \cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}B). 
Adaptive loss-of-function mutations can be an effective way to gain new metabolic functions in new environmental conditions \cite{Hottes2013-np}.
Taking advantage of the conserved lipase domain of HPC1 in bacteria, we used a new method that is able to identify how genetic variation of protein domains is correlated with bacteria optimal growth temperature \cite{Jensen2021-iv, Jensen2021-zm} and we mapped the possible causal mutation of HPC1 to an SNP in the flap-lid domain of HPC1 (\cref{Fig5}A) that probably affects substrate  accessibility and/or substrate binding (\cref{Fig5}A). 
Indeed, the flap lid domain has been the target of biotechnological modification of these types of enzymes \cite{Khan2017-ua}.
The flap-lid domain is located right at a recombination point that separates two clear LD blocks. 
The first one covers the 2 kb promoter region of \hpc and the first 600 bp of \hpc and the second one covers the rest of \textit{HPC1's} CDS. 
In fact, this pattern is characteristic of selective sweeps that leave two LD blocks on the sides of the adaptive mutation sweep \cite{Kim2004-pa}. 
Linkage disequilibrium analysis together with the open chromatin ATAC-Seq overlapping the same promoter region (\cref{Fig4}B) and the correlation of \hpc and flowering time (\cref{Fig6}E) in the manuscript suggest a possible transcriptional regulation of HPC1 that could act in an additive way with the CDS variant we have identified.   

Why were the metabolic changes induced by HPC1 variation selected for in highland maize?
PC metabolism is intimately connected to multiple stress responses and developmental pathways; alterations in PC amounts and PC/LPC ratios affect overall plant fitness.
The \textit{qPC/LPC3@8.5} QTL is driven by individual QTLs of PC and LPC species with high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (\cref{Fig3}D).
Several of these species, like PC 36:5 and LPC 18:1 (\cref{Fig3}D, Sup. File 3), have been shown to display similar patterns during Arabidopsis cold acclimation \cite{Welti2002-uk} and sorghum (\textit{Sorghum bicolor}) low temperature responses \cite{Marla2017-ph}.
PC 36:5 also showed high $Q_{ST}$ values when comparing highland and lowland landraces from both Mesoamerica and South America (\cref{Fig1}C-D, Sup. File 5).
In maize, \hpc expression is under the control of the circadian clock \cite{Khan2010-iv} with a peak at the end of the day. 
In Arabidopsis, highly unsaturated PC (34:3, 34:4, 36:5, 36:6) species increase in the dark \cite{Maatta2012-ip}. 
This peak of concentration coincides in maize with low expression levels of \hpc during the same dark hours \cite{Khan2010-iv}.
PC, and lipid metabolism in general, is also intimately connected to flowering time. 
Nakamura and colleagues elegantly demonstrated that PCs can bind to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the shoot apical meristem to hasten flowering \cite{Nakamura2014-qf, Nakamura2019-ht} by unknown cellular mechanisms. 
Recently, Susila and collaborators have shown that in Arabidopsis, PG species can sequester FT in phloem companion cells in low temperatures \cite{Susila2021-dz} and, when temperatures increase, release it into the phloem where it would reach the shoot apical meristem.   
Additionally, Qu and collaborators also showed that activity of a secretory phospholipase D can delay heading time in rice \cite{Qu2021-wc}.
In line with the role of phospholipids in flowering time, we found that genetic variation at SNPs within the  \hpc lipase domain have a strong interaction with elevation and the highland \textit{HPC1-PT} allele. 
This leads to an increase of flowering time in low elevations and a reduction in high elevations of close to one day. 
Interestingly, the effect of the highland allele exhibited typical conditional neutrality in yield-related traits, with increased fitness conferred by the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele in highlands (\cref{Fig4}A). 
In the NAM population a SNP also on the \hpc lipase domain is associated with a reduction of 8 hours in flowering time with respect to B73 \cite{Wallace2014-yy} further supporting the role of \hpc in controlling flowering time. 
Analysis of \hpc CRISPR mutant alleles in B104 grown in Raleigh showed a PC/LPC phenotype that mimicked the highland allele (\cref{figure:Sup:CRISPR_effect}A-B) but not a flowering time phenotype, probably due to the strong G x E effect of \hpc. 

The strong G x E effect we observed in \hpc is similar to the well-known teosinte \mex introgression \textit{inv4m} \cite{Crow2020-gene}. 
In fact, our analysis showed that \hpc is indeed another introgression from teosinte \texit{mexicana} (\cref{Fig6}A-C). 
Recent analysis using sympatric teosinte and maize populations across elevation gradients in Mexico further support the introgression of \mex in \hpc and show that \mex ancestry of \hpc increases a rate of +0.079 per 100 m of elevation \cite{Calfee2021-mr}.
We then further showed that the \texit{mexicana} intogression in \hpc is conserved in high latitude adapted Flint lines from both Europe and the USA (\cref{Fig6}D).
\textit{HPC1} in inbred lines carrying the highland \textit{ZxHPC1} \mex haplotype was expressed at low levels and resulted in earlier flowering (\cref{Fig6}E) \cite{Kremling2018-gn}.  

Adaptation to higher latitudes involved a reduction of photoperiod sensitivity and flowering time that enabled maize to thrive in longer day conditions characteristic of the growing season in high latitudes \cite{Hung2012-ms, Swarts2017-ge, Yang2013-lg, Huang2018-ga}.
Additive mutations in the regulatory region of in the transcription factor \textit{ZCN8} \cite{Lazakis2011-nq}, including a teosinte \mex introgression, lead to higher expression of \textit{ZCN8}, which contributes to maize adaptation to long days in temperate conditions \cite{Guo2019-pn}.
\textit{ZCN8} is a close ortholog of Arabidopsis \textit{FT} that interacts with several species of phospholipids to fine regulate flowering time \cite{Nakamura2014-qf, Susila2021-dz}.  
We hypothesized that this interaction that has also being shown in rice \cite{Qu2021-wc} could also be occurring in maize. 
Comparison of docking simulations of phospholipids with \textit{ZCN8} using the Arabidopsis \textit{FT} crystal structures as a model \cite{Nakamura2019-ht} showed similar PC interactions in \textit{ZCN8} (\cref{figure:Sup:Docking}).
This interaction was further corroborated via analysis of mass spectrometry analysis of lipids bound to ZCN8 heterologously expressed in yeast (\cref{figure:Sup:ZCN8-PC}. 

In summary, here we used a combination of genomic scans, linkage mapping, lipidomics and reverse genetics to identify and clone the adaptive gene \hpc, introgressed from teosinte  \mex, in highland maize landraces. HPC1 leads to a major reorganization of phosphatidylcholine metabolism. 
We showed that the fitness advantage conferred by the \hpc highland \mex allele is at least in part due to its effect on accelerating flowering and that this effect may have contributed to adaptation of maize to cold, high latitudes. 
Our work is the first to identify the important role of a gene controlling phospholipid metabolism in plant local adaptation and further supports the emerging role of phospholipid metabolism in fine-tuning flowering time across different plant species \cite{Nakamura2014-qf, Susila2021-dz, Guo2019-pn}.
This study highlights the largely underappreciated role of highland maize and highland teosinte \mex in modern maize.
\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:materials:methods}
\subsection{Populations used in the analysis.} 
Highland and lowland populations used for Population Branch Excess analysis consisted of three to six accessions from each of the highland and lowland populations and have been previously described in \cite{Wang2020-mp, Wang2017-bc}. 
The 120 landraces from the HiLo diversity panel were selected and ordered from the \href{http://mgb.cimmyt.org/gringlobal/search.aspx}{CIMMYT germplasm bank} to maximize a good latitudinal gradient sampling across Mesoamerica and South America. 
For each highland landrace (>2,000 meters above sea level [masl]) a lowland landrace (<1,000 masl) was selected at the same latitude (<0.5\degree) to form 60 highland/lowland pairs, with 30 from each continent. 
The list of the accessions used is provided in Sup. file 1.   
B73 x Palomero Toluqueño (PT) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed by crossing B73 with a single PT plant (Mexi5 accession, CIMMYTMA 2233) that was then backcrossed with B73 once and selfed five times (BC1S5).  
We used  individual landrace accession genotype and fitness data from the CIMMYT Seeds of Discovery project (SeeD) \cite{Gates2019-xu} to calculate \textit{pcadapt} \cite{Luu2017-ws} values and GxE effects of \textit{HPC1-PT}.
\subsection{Field Experimental Conditions and sampling.} 
Two replicates of the HiLo diversity panel accessions and three replicates of the B73 x PT RILs were planted in a highland and lowland common gardens. 
The highland common garden was located in Metepec, Edo de M\'exico, (19\degree13'28.7"N 99\degree32'51.6"W) in the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. 
The field is at 2,610 masl, and the range of average monthly temperatures along the year vary from 5\degree C to 21.5\degree C.  
The lowland common garden was located in Valle de Banderas, Nayarit, (20\degree47'01.2"N 105\degree14'47.0"W) in the Pacific Coast. 
The field is at 50 masl, and the range of average monthly temperatures along the year vary from 20\degree C to 29\degree C.
Between growth stages V4 and V6, we used a leaf puncher to collect 50 mg of fresh tissue (10 discs) from the tip of the second leaf above the last leaf with a fully developed collar. 
Tissue discs were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
We collected all samples from a field in a single day between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm, approximately 3 h after sunrise.
Samples were transported in dry ice to the lab and stored at --80\degree C until extraction. 
\subsection{Glycerolipid analysis.} 
We crushed frozen samples in a Retsch tissue grinder (Haan, Germany) for 40 seconds at a frequency of 30 pulses per second. 
We performed lipid extraction following Matyash and collaborators \cite{Matyash2008-ue}. 
First, we added 225 $\upmu$L of cold methanol (MeOH) to each sample. 
For the blanks, we prepared MeOH containing a Quality Control (QC) mix (Sup. File 6).
We vortexed each sample for 10 sec, keeping the rest of the material on ice. 
Then, we added 750 $\upmu$L of cold methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). 
For the blanks, we used MTBE containing 22:1 cholesterol ester as internal standard (Sup. File 6). 
We vortexed each sample for 10 sec, followed by 6 min of shaking at 4\degree C in the orbital mixer. 
We next added 188 $\upmu$L of LC/MS grade water at room temperature (RT), and vortexed samples for 20 sec.
We centrifuged the samples for 2 min at 14,000 rcf and recovered 700 $\upmu$L of supernatant from the upper organic phase. 
We then split the supernatant into two aliquots of 350 $\upmu$L each, one aliquot was used for the generation of the lipid profile and the other aliquot was used to prepare pools that were used along the lipid profiling. 
Finally, we dried the samples using a speed vacuum concentration system.
We resuspended dried samples in 110 $\upmu$L of MeOH-Toluene 90:10 (with the internal standard CUDA, 50 ng/mL). 
We vortexed samples at low speed for 20 sec and then sonicated them at RT for 5 min. 
We then transferred aliquots of 50 $\upmu$L per sample into an insert within an amber glass vial.
The UHPLC-QTOF MS/MS utilized were Agilent 1290 and Agilent 6530, respectively. 
We used a Waters Acquity charged surface hybrid (CSH) C18 2.1x100 mm 1.7 $\upmu$m column which we initially purged for 5 min. 
We coupled the UHPLC column with a VanGuard pre-column (Waters Acquity CSH C18 1.7$\upmu$m). 
We injected six “no sample injections” at the beginning of each run to condition the column, followed by ten samples, one pool (made out of the mix of the second aliquot of all the samples contained per UHPLC plate) and one blank.
We injected 1.67 $\upmu$L per sample into UHPLC-QTOF MS/MS ESI (+); the running time per sample was 15 min. 
Mobile phase “A” consisted of 60:40 acetonitrile:water, 10 mM of ammonium formate and 0.1\% formic acid. 
Mobile phase “B” consisted of 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1\% of formic acid. 
The flow rate was 0.6 mL/min and the column compartment was maintained at 65° C. Initial conditions were 15\% B; the gradient uniformly increased until reaching 100\%. 
At 12.10 min the mobile phase composition returned to initial conditions.
We used the mass spectrometer (Q-TOF MS/MS) in positive electrospray ionization mode (ESI).
The source parameters were: ESI gas temperature 325 \degree C, nebulizer pressure 35 psig, gas flow 11L/min, capillary voltage 3500 V, nozzle voltage 1000 V, and MS TOF fragmentor and skimmer 120 and 65 V, respectively.
We used a mass range between 60 and 1,700 m/z, under acquisition parameters. 
As for reference mass parameters, we used a detection window of 100 ppm and a minimum height of 1,000 counts. 
We performed a retention time (rt) correction of the acquired data using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.06.00 version and Microsoft Excel. 
To extract ion chromatograms (EICs) of the internal standards within the run we used Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis.
We identified the time of the highest intensity point of each EIC, which we used as the current retention time of the experiment. 
We used the method retention time for internal standards and the current rt and we fitted a polynomial regression to calculate new retention times using retention times from 501 lipids of a MS1 m/z-rt library (See Sup. File 7). 
In MSDIAL \cite{Tsugawa2015-kh}, identification of lipids is based on two approaches: the MSP file and MS/MS identification setting included in MSDIAL and the use of a post identification file containing accurate m/z and rt for a list of lipids. 
In this study we used both identification approaches. 
Under positive ion mode, the MSP file and MS/MS identification setting has a total of 51 lipid classes  selectable for identification. 
The post identification file that we used was the retention time-corrected MS1-MS2 mz-rt lipid library that we explained before. 
We used MSDIAL \cite{Tsugawa2015-kh} version 3.40. 
To use MSDIAL, we converted the raw data from .d to .abf format with Reifycs Abf converter (https://www.reifycs.com/AbfConverter/). 
Then, we filtered the MSDIAL alignment results based on whether compounds intensity was ten times above blank intensity. Next, filtered data were normalized using Systematic Error Removal using Random Forest (SERRF) \cite{Fan2019}. This normalization is based on the QC pool samples. 
We filtered out, now the normalized features, considering a coefficient of variation (CV) equal or less than 30\% among the pools. 
To curate the data for duplicate features, isotopes and ion-adducts, we utilized MS-FLO \cite{DeFelice2017-ms}.
We also normalized the curated data using the sum of all known metabolite signal (mTIC). 
After data processing and normalization, we used lipid intensities for further analysis.
\subsection{CRISPR-CAS9 Glycerolipid analysis}
Dry samples were resuspended in 110 $\upmu$L of 100\% MeOH (with the internal standard CUDA, 50 ng/mL), vortexed at low speed for 20 s and then sonicated at RT for 5 min. 
We transferred the samples into amber glass vials with inserts prior to analysis. 
Lipid profiling was performed using a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer coupled to a Thermo Vanquish Horizon UHPLC. 
Chromatographic separation was achieved using the same guard and analytical column type, mobile phase composition and gradient conditions described for UHPLC-QTOF analyses. 
Avanti Splash Lipidomix Mass Spec Standard (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama) was used to check system suitability and a Lipid QC Standard Mixture (Sup. File 6) and pooled QC samples were used to monitor instrument performance. 
Methanol solvent blanks were injected at the beginning of the sequence and throughout the batch between approximately 10 injections and pooled QC samples were injected between every 6–8 sample injections. 
For ion source parameters the spray voltage was set at 3500 V, sheath gas 60 (arb), aux gas 15 (arb), sweep gas 2 (arb) and ion transfer tube and vaporizer temp at 350 \degree C. 
Full scan and data-dependent MS/MS (ddMS\textsuperscript{2}) scans were collected in positive ESI mode following 2 $\mu$L sample injections. 
Full scan spectra were obtained from \textit{m/z} 220--1700 using an Orbitrap resolution setting of 120,000, RF lens set at 25\%, normalized AGC target at 25\% and maximum injection time set to auto. 
ddMS\textsuperscript{2} scans were performed using a cycle time of 0.6 sec, intensity threshold of 5.0e4, and a 3 sec dynamic exclusion using a 10 ppm mass tolerance. 
Additional parameters for ddMS\textsuperscript{2} experiments were as follows: Isolation window equal to 1 Da, stepped collision energy at 20 and 30\%, Orbitrap resolution set to 15,000, scan range set to auto, normalized AGC target of 100\% and a maximum ion injection time of 55 msec. 
Data files were uploaded to LipidSearch 4.2.2 (Thermo Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) for identification of PC and LPC species. 
Skyline-daily \cite{Adams2020-em} was then used to obtain normalized peak areas for the identified PCs and LPCs using the internal standards PC(12:0/13:0) and LPC(17:0), respectively.
\subsection{$\mathbf{Q_{ST}-F_{ST}}$ analysis of glycerolipid data.}
To maximize independence between traits for Qst analysis we clustered the phospholipid traits based on correlation values into 20 groups with complete-linkage hierarchical clustering. Single metabolites were then selected from each cluster, resulting in 20 minimally correlated traits \cref{figure:Sup:lipid_clusters}. Quantitative trait differentiation ($Q_{ST}$) was contrasted to the distribution of $F_{ST}$ for neutral genetic markers \cite{whitlock2008evolutionary}. 
highland/lowland contrasts were considered separately for Mesoamerica and South America.
A linear mixed effects model (R package lmer, function lmer) was used to partition phenotypic variance between population pairs (Mesoamerica/South America, all highland/all lowland, Mesoamerican highland/Mesoamerican lowland, South American highland/South American lowland). 
Genotypes were obtained previously from the same plants used for glycerolipid analysis \cite{Janzen2021-lz}.
\begin{center}
${ TRAIT \sim 1 + (1|POPULATION) + }$\\
${(1|GARDEN/BLOCK) + (1|BATCH)}$
\end{center}
Within-population and between-population variances were calculated with the R function VarCorr (R package \texttt{lme4}, \citealp{bates2014lme4}), and were used to calculate $Q_{ST}$ following the equation below:
\begin{center}
$Q_{ST}$ = \(\sigma^{2}_{GB}/(\sigma^{2}_{GB}+2\sigma^{2}_{GW})\)
\end{center}
\noindent in which $\sigma^{2}_{GB}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{GW}$ are the between- and within-population genetic variance components, respectively \cite{Leinonen2013-ic}.
Pairwise $F_{ST}$ was calculated with the R function fst.each.snp.hudson (R package \textit{dartR}, \citealp{gruber2018dartr}).
In our design,$\sigma^{2}_{GW}$ includes both additive and nonadditive components. 
This assumption leads to conservative estimation of 
Consideration of non additive gene actions  appears  to  contribute  to  underestimation  of $Q_{ST}$ \cite{Whitlock1999-gu}, but for purposes of studying diversifying selection, the test will remain conservative \cite{Kronholm2010-by}.
\subsection{\textit{pcadapt} analysis of biological adaptation in Mexican landraces.}
In order to conduct genome scans for signatures of adaptation we used the \textit{pcadapt} \cite{Luu2017-ws} package.
\textit{pcadapt} identifies adaptive loci by measuring how strongly loci are contributing to patterns of differentiation between major axes of genetic variation.
Under simple models \textit{pcadapt} captures major patterns of $F_{ST}$  but is conducted in a way that does not require population delimitation \cite{duforet2014genome}.
As the genome scan comparison requires a focal SNP to be compared to the first K principal components of the genotype data, it can be biased by large regions of low recombination that drive the major axes of variation in the principal components.
Thus, when SNPs from these low recombination regions are compared against principal components driven by linked loci spurious signals may arise.
To prevent this bias from occurring, we used custom scripts to calculate the principal component step separately based upon all the chromosomes except for the chromosome of the focal SNPs being tested.
The genotype data we used for this analysis was GBS data from roughly 2,000 landraces of Mexican origin collected by CIMMYT (www.cimmyt.org) as part of the SeeDs of discovery initiative (https://www.cimmyt.org/projects/seeds-of-discovery-seed/).
From this, we calculated the strength of association between each SNP and the first five principal components (excluding the chromosome of the focal SNP) using the communality statistic as implemented in \textit{pcadapt} version 3.0.4.
\subsection{Glycerolipid pathways selection.}
We compiled a list of genes pertinent to glycerolipid metabolism starting with a search of all genes belonging to the \textit{Zea mays} 'Glycerophospholipid metabolism' and 'Glycerolipid metabolism' KEGG pathways \cite{kanehisa2019} (map identifiers: zma00564 and zma00561). 
With the NCBI Entrez gene identifiers in KEGG we retrieved the AGPv4 transcript identifiers used in Corncyc 8.0 \cite{portwood2019, walsh2016} from an id cross reference \href{https://www.maizegdb.org/search/gene/download_gene_xrefs.php?relative=v4}{file} found in MaizeGDB   \cite{portwood2019}.
This resulted in a list of 300 genes comprising 51 Corncyc pathways. 
Then we discarded Corncyc pathways  tangentially connected to the KEGG glycerolipid metabolism list (sharing just one enzyme with the initial KEGG list) or that we judged to belong to different biological processes (e.g 'long chain fatty acid synthesis','anthocyanin biosynthesis'). 
Finally, we added manually the 'phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis V' pathway that was missing. 
The list of 30 selected Corncyc pathways included genes outside the initial KEGG search results and raised the number of genes to 557. 
In addition to these, 37 genes were found to have an enzymatic activity related to phospholipid metabolism but not placed into any particular pathway, i.e orphan enzymes, consisting mostly of alcohol dehydrogenases. 
Sixteen additional genes found in KEGG were not annotated at all in Corncyc probably due to differences between AGPv4 and RefSeq pseudogene annotation of the maize genome. 
The list of all possible candidates coming either from KEGG or Corncyc that were orphan enzymes or were unannotated in Corncyc amounted to 597 genes (Sup. File 2). 
This process is documented in the \verb|0_get_glycerolipid_genes.R| script of the \verb|pgplipid| R package accompanying this paper \cite{fausto_rodriguez_zapata_2020_4323410}.
\subsection{Population Branch Excess Analysis.}
Population Branch Excess quantifies changes in allele frequencies in focal populations relative to two independent “outgroup” populations.
We used \textit{Zea mays spp. parviglumis} as one of the outgroup populations for all four highland groups.  
The other outgroup was  Mexican lowlands  in the case of Southwestern US , Mexican highlands and Guatemalan highlands; and South American lowlands in the case of the Andes population. 
We used calculated PBE SNP values for the four populations (described in detail in \cite{Wang2020-mp}) and we tested for selection outliers SNPs in the 594 phosphoglycerolipid-related candidate genes and the 30 Corncyc pathways (556 genes).
We first defined PBE outlier SNPs as the top 5\% of the PBE score distribution; this fraction corresponds to approximately 50000 out of ~1 million genotyped SNPs in each population. 
Following \cite{Wang2020-mp}, we defined a gene as a PBE outlier if it contained an outlier SNP within the coding sequence or 10 kb upstream/downstream. 
Then we tested for over-representation of genes selected in particular subsets of populations using Fisher's exact test with the 32,283 protein-coding genes from the maize genome as background. 
For each pathway, we first selected all SNPs within coding regions and 10 kb upstream and downstream of genes in the pathway and we calculated the mean pathway PBE score. 
We then constructed a null distribution by drawing 10,000 samples without replacement of $n$ SNPs from those found within 10 kb upstream and downstream of all protein-coding genes and we obtained the mean PBE for this null distribution. 
With the set of PBE outliers for glycerolipid metabolism in the four populations, we tested for evidence of physiological or pleiotropic constraint using the $C_\chi^2$ statistic \cite{yeaman2018}. 
\subsection{QTL analysis of phospholipid levels.}
We analyzed glycerophospholipid QTLs in a mapping population of 57 RILs (BC1S5) from the cross B73 x PT.
These RILs were grown in a highland site in Metepec, Edo de M\'exico at 2,600 masl during the summer of 2016 and in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco at 50 masl during the winter of 2016/17. 
We analyzed the samples using UHPLC-QTOF, as above, and 67 leaf lipid species were identified.
For QTL analysis we calculated the mean across all fields of individual lipid mass signal. 
We also used as phenotypes the sum total of the following lipid classes: diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, PCs and  LPCs.  
Furthermore,  we also included the log base 10 transformed ratios of LPCs/PCs and the ratios of their individual species. 
We did a simple single marker analysis  with ``scanone`` using Haley-Knott  regression, and assessed the QTL significance with 1,000 permutations.
\subsection{CRISPR-Cas9 editing of \hpc and analysis of the effect of \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} mutant on flowering time.}
CRISPR/Cas9 was used to create a \hpc mutant through Agrobacterium \textit{Agrobacterium tumefaciens}-mediated transformation of background line B104 \cite{Wu2020-nq, Char2017-uk}. 
RNA guides (gRNAs) were designed as described in \cite{Brazelton2015-co} for the B73 reference genome v4. 
The B104 and B73 sequence for \hpc were identical. 
The gRNA cassette was cloned into pGW-Cas9 using Gateway cloning. 
Two plants from the T\textsubscript{0} transgenic events were identified through genomic PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing and were self-pollinated. 
In the next generation, several plants were allowed to self.
Plants were genotyped using forward primer CAGTTCTCATCCCATGCACG and reverse primer CCTGATGAGAGCTGAGGTCC.
%Homozygous \textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} T2 plants were  used for lipid analysis in greenhouses at  North Carolina State University during Spring 2020 and then self-pollinated. 
Cas9 positivity was tested for using 0.05\% glufosinate ammonium contained in Liberty herbicide or by PCR genotyping. 
\textit{hpc1\textsuperscript{CR}} T2 plants grown in Raleigh, NC under long day conditions were used for flowering time and lipid analysis.
Wild-type plants from the same segregating families were used for analysis.
\subsection{Cell-free protein production and substrate analysis}
HPC1-B73 and HPC1-PT were synthesized without the chloroplast transit peptide and codon optimized for expression in wheat. 
Protein was produced using the WEPRO7240 Kit from CellFree Sciences (Yokohama, Japan).
Briefly, RNA was generated from the DNA templates using reverse transcription. 
Cooled RNA reactions were then mixed with creatine kiinase and WEPRO 7240 extract. 
This mixture was layered with translation buffer and incubated for 20 hours at 15\textdegree C.
The bilayer was mixed and protein snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80 \textdegree C.
Protein was incubated with various phospholipids for one hour in a buffer of 250mM TRIS-HCl, 0.7M NaCl, and 10mM CaCl\textsubcript{2}, pH 7.4.
\subsection{Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (IR-MALDESI-MS) analysis}
LC-MS grade acetonitrile, water, and formic acid for the electrospray solvent and microscope slides were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Nazareth, PA, USA). 
The IR-MALDESI-MS platform has been described previously \cite{Caleb_Bagley2021-eh, Bokhart2016-he}. 
A 2970 nm laser (JGMA, Burlington, MA, USA) desorbed neutral molecules from the sample with a single burst of 10 pulses fired at 10 kHz (1.2 mJ/burst). 
The orthogonal electrospray plume consisted of 60:40 (v/v) acetonitrile/water with 0.2\% formic acid. 
The electrospray flow rate was fixed at 2.0 µL/min and a 3600 kV potential was applied to the emitter tip. 
 The IR-MALDESI source was coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris\textsuperscript{TM} 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) for high resolution, accurate mass analysis. 
The automatic gain control was disabled, and the ion accumulation time was fixed at 25 ms. 
The mass spectrometer collected mass spectra in positive mode over \textit{m/z} 175 – 1000. 
The multi-injection RF threshold fixed at 6 to inject ions over the entire \textit{m/z} range of interest through the S-lens for the duration of the ion accumulation time. 
The EASY-IC (fluoranthene, \textit{m/z} 202.0777) was used for internal calibration to obtain parts per million mass measurement accuracy. 
The mass spectrometer resolution was fixed at 240,000\textsubscript{FWHM} at \textit{m/z} 200. The RF-level applied to the S-lens ion guide was fixed at 70\% for all analyses. 
RastirX software paired with an Arduino microcontroller (Arduino, Ivrea, Italy) was used to coordinate electronic signals required for each analysis \cite{Garrard2020-nt}. 
For each IR-MALDESI-MS analysis, 1 µL of sample was pipetted onto a glass microscope slide and placed on the sample stage with the focal point of the laser focused at the top of the sample droplet.
Mass spectra were viewed in QualBrowser directly. 
For data analysis and visualization, the raw datafiles were converted from the .RAW formal to .mzML files using MS Convert within the ProteoWizard software package \cite{Chambers2012-da}. 
The .mzML files were then converted to .imzML files using imzMLConverter \cite{Race2012-wl}. 
The .imzML files were converted to .xlsx files using MSiReader v1.03c to effectively compile multiple analyses onto a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet \cite{Robichaud2013-ao, Bokhart2018-hs}.
\subsection{Expression analysis of \hpc in B73, PT and B73xPT F1 hybrids in conditions simulating highland environments.}
Gene expression data were generated from leaf tissue from B73, PT and the B73xPT F1 hybrids. 
Plants were grown following the same protocol as in \cite{Crow2020-gene}.
Briefly, kernels were planted in growth chambers set to imitate spring temperature conditions in the Mexican lowlands (22$^{\circ}$C night, 32$^{\circ}$C day, 12 hr light) and highlands (11$^{\circ}$C night, 22$^{\circ}$C day, 12 hr light). 
Leaf tissue was sampled from the V3 leaf the day after the leaf collar became visible, between 2 and 4 hr after dawn. 
Tissue was immediately placed in a centrifuge tube, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at --70$^{\circ}$C.
RNA-seq libraries were constructed, sequenced, and analyzed following \cite{Crow2020-gene}. 
Briefly, randomly primed, strand specific, mRNA-seq libraries were constructed using the BRaD-seq \cite{townsley2015brad} protocol.
Multiplexed libraries were sequenced on 1 lane of an Illumina HiSeq X platform. 
Low quality reads and adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic v.0.36 \cite{bolger2014trimmomatic}, and the remaining paired reads were aligned to the maize reference genome B73 v4 and quantified using \texttt{kallisto} v.0.42.3 \cite{bray2016near}. 
Gene counts were normalized using the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) with the \textit{calcNormFactors} function in \textit{edgeR} \cite{robinson2010edger} and converted to log2CPM.
\subsection{Sanger sequencing of \hpc in RILs homozygous at the \textit{qPC/LPC3@8.5} locus.}
We identified 3 RILs homozygous for the PT allele at the \hpc locus and we developed 6 sets of primers to sequence by Sanger across the coding region and the promoter. 
The location of primers along the locus are shown in Sup. file 8. 
\subsection{Association of \hpc with agronomic traits}.
We re-analyzed phenotypic data from the F\textsubscript{1} Association Mapping (FOAM) panel of Romero-Navarro \textit{et al} \cite{Romero_Navarro2017-cn} and Gates \textit{et al} \cite{Gates2019-xu} to more fully characterize association signatures of \hpc. 
Full descriptions of this experiment and data access are described in these references. 
We downloaded BLUPs for each trait and line from Germinate 3, and subset the data to only those lines with GBS genotype data from M\'exico. 
We fit a similar model to the GWAS model used by \cite{Gates2019-xu} to estimate the effect of the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele on the traits' intercept and slope on trial elevation, accounting for effects of tester ID in each field and genetic background and family effects on the trait intercept and slope using four independent random effects. 
We implemented this model in the \textit{R} package \textit{GridLMM} \cite{Runcie2019-Gr}. 
We extracted effect sizes and covariances conditional on the REML variance component estimates and used these to calculate standard errors for the total \textit{HPC1-PT} effect as a function of elevation. 
To test whether the phenotypic effects of \textit{HPC1-PT} on yield components might be explained as indirect effects via flowering time, we additionally re-fit each model using days to anthesis (DTA) as a covariate with an independent effect in each trial.
\subsection{Identification of features and domains of HPC1.}
The domains of \hpc were analyzed from UniProt identifier \hyperlink{https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0A1D6MIA3}{A0A1D6MIA3}. 
The \hyperlink{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/pfam/PF01764/}{Lipase3--PFAM - PF01764}, and \hyperlink{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR029058/}{alpha/beta Hydrolase fold} were identified using InterPro, and \hyperlink{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=cd00519}{Lipase3-CDD}, shown in cyan, including flap lid, shown in magenta, and the S293, D357, and H400 catalytic triad were identified from CDD. 
H416 was identified as a substitute for H400 in the catalytic triad by protein modeling.
\subsection{Bacterial optimal growth temperature association with HPC1 flap-lid domain allelic variation}.
We compared the maize HPC1 protein sequence to prokaryotes with the same sequence to determine whether the identified residue change in maize and accompanying association with low temperature survival was consistent with observations in other organisms. 
We identified the Pfam domain PF01764 in the B73 protein sequence using the HMMER3 web server, we also identified 982 observations of the PF01764 Pfam domain in 719 prokaryote species using PfamScan \cite{Potter2018-tk, El-Gebali2019-pw}. 
We predicted the optimal growth temperature of these species using tRNA sequences as in \cite{Cimen2020-dm}. 
We aligned the maize and prokaryote PF01764 domain sequences with hmmalign from the hmmer3 package \cite{Eddy2011-pd}, and the aligned Pfam sequences were recoded to reflect nine amino acid physicochemical properties \cite{Li2016-ut}. 
We filtered the sequences to remove gaps in the domain alignment and observations with only partial domain sequences, then we clustered them based on sequence similarity, resulting in two clusters of observations within the domain. 
For each cluster, positions in the filtered alignment were associated with prokaryote optimal growth temperatures using a linear regression with all nine amino acid physicochemical properties. 
Seventeen sites in and around the flap-lid region of the protein passed a 10\% FDR significance threshold, including the single residue change V211I previously identified in \textit{HPC1-PT}. 
Welch’s two-sided t-test was used to compare the optimal growth temperatures of prokaryote species with the same (V) \textit{HPC1-B73} aminoacid residue to the optimal growth temperatures of prokaryote species with the same (I) \textit{HPC1-B73} allele at this site.
\subsection{Subcellular localization of \hpc.}
We fused the HPC1-B73 chloroplast transit peptide (CTP, 52 aminocacids) to GFP. 
Three constructs encoding subcellular localization markers were used as control; cytoplasm (C-GFP), nucleus (N-GFP), and chloroplast (P-GFP).
All markers were under the control of the cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. 
These constructs were transiently infiltrated in \textit{Nicotiana benthamiana} leaf cells.
\subsection{Teosinte \mex introgression in highland maize.}
To evaluate if the \textit{HPC1-PT} allele is the result of standing variation from teosinte \parv or an introgression from \mex we used Patterson's \textit{D} \cite{Patterson2012-sw} statistic and genome-wide $f_{d}$ \cite{Martin2015-ee} to calculate ABBA-BABA patterns. 
The data were obtained from \cite{Gonzalez-Segovia2019-jy}. 
The material used in \cite{Gonzalez-Segovia2019-jy} included whole-genome sequence data from three highland outbred individuals: two PT and one Mushito de Michoacán; three lowland landraces: Nal Tel (RIMMA0703) and Zapalote Chico (RIMMA0733) obtained from \cite{Wang2017-bc} and  BKN022 from \cite{Bukowski2017-ng}; two \mex inbred lines: TIL08 and TIL25; three \parv inbred lines: TIL01, TIL05, TIL10 and \textit{Tripsacum} TDD39103 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng} as an outlier. 
\subsection{Haplotype network analysis of \hpc in Mexican maize landraces and teosintes.}
We extracted SNP genotypes for \hpc from the TIL teosinte accessions in the HapMap 3 imputed data \cite{Bukowski2017-ng} and the 3700 Mexican landraces in the SeeD dataset. 
With the set of 1060 accessions that were homozygous at all sites in this genomic region we calculated a haplotype network depicting the minimal spanning tree for haplotypes covering 90\% of the input accessions with the R package \code{pegas} \cite{paradis2010}, and haplotype frequencies for three elevation classes in the landraces (0--1,000; 1,000--2,000 and >3,000 masl).
\subsection{Clustering analysis of \hpc in maize inbred lines and teosintes.}
Using v3 of the B73 genome, \hpc SNPs were obtained from PT (this paper), the 282 diversity panel \cite{Flint-Garcia2005-hb}, teosinte inbred lines and the German inbred lines from HapMap 3 \cite{Bukowski2017-ng}. 
The selection was made to have a good representation of tropical, temperate and European inbred lines together with teosintes and PT lines.
SNPs were aligned using Geneious2020.0.5 and a neighbor-joining cluster analysis was generated. 
To facilitate visualization and interpretation of the tree we condensed cluster branches from lines with identical haplotypes and from similar geographic locations. 
The full tree is available as Sup. file 9. 
\subsection{Expression analysis of candidate genes and association with flowering traits in the 282 diversity panel.}
We used gene expression RNA-seq data obtained from the 282 diversity panel at different developmental stages \cite{Kremling2018-gn} and BLUP values of several flowering and photoperiod sensitivity traits \cite{Hung2012-ms} to study the correlation of \hpc expression values with flowering time traits.  
\subsection{Heterologous expression, purification of \textit{ZCN8} using \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and analysis of ZCN8-lipid binding}
We synthesized \textit{ZCN8} codon optimized for \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and tagged with a SPOT peptide tag (Chromotek, Planegg, Germany); this construct will further be called ZCN8-SPOT. 
ZCN8-SPOT was then transformed into the galactose inducible vector pYES-DEST52 and expressed in \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} strain FY4. 
After 8 hours of induction, cultures were harvested and frozen for future protein extractions. 
We purified protein with Chromotek SPOT-Cap beads (Chromotek, Planegg, Germany) and generally followed their protocol. 
Briefly, 50mL of induction pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (10mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150mM Nacl, 0.5mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1mM DTT, 10mM MgCl\textsubscript{2}, 1x HALT protease and phsophatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 1\% dodecylmaltoside) and ground in a Genogrinder with glass beads at max speed for one minute.
This was followed by one minute on ice and repeated for a total of three minutes of grinding.
The sample was then incubated on ice for five minutes, vortexed, and incubated for another five minutes. 
After pelleting, the supernatant was diluted with wash buffer (10mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150mM NaCL, 0.5mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1X HALT protease and phosphatse inhibitor, and 0.1\% dodecylmaltoside) and put onto cleaned, equilibrated SPOT-Cap beads and left rotating at 4\textdegree C for one hour.
The beads and lysate were separated by centrifugation at 2500xg for five minutes and the beads were washed three times with 20x bead volume of wash buffer. 
Protein was eluted with either SPOT-peptide or 100mM Glycine, pH 2.0. 
Glycine elutions were immediately neutralized with an equivalent amount of TRIS base, pH 10.4.
Elutions were frozen and lipids were extracted and analyzed at a later date as described above. 
The comparison data between an authentic standard and ZCN8-SPOT yeast was acquired with the same lipid profiling method as described in the Materials and Methods section for the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer with the following modifications: sample injection volume was increased to 10 $\mu$L, full scan spectra were acquired from \emph{m/z} 200 – 1000 and \emph{m/z} 758.5694 was included in the target mass list for MS\textsuperscript{2} selection.

\caption{\textbf{A} Mass spectrum of ZCN8-SPOT yeast sample compared to the theoretical isotopic pattern of PC(34:2) at [M+H]\textsuperscript{+} \textit{m/z} 758.5694. The experimental \textit{m/z} and mass measurement accuracy (MMA) are labeled. The spectrum of ZCN8-SPOT is an average of 16 scans across the chromatographic peak of \textit{m/z} 758.5694.  
\textbf{B} Extracted ion chromatogram of \textit{m/z} 758.5694 from the PC(16:0/18:2) standard and ZCN8-SPOT yeast from two separate injections.  
\textbf{C} MS\textsuperscript{2} fragmentation spectra comparison for \textit{m/z} 758.5694 from ZCN8-SPOT yeast and the PC(16:0/18:2) standard.
The comparison data between an authentic standard and ZCN8-SPOT yeast was acquired with the same lipid profiling method as described in the Materials and Methods section for the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer with the following modifications:  the injection volume was 10 $\mu$L, full scan spectra were acquired from \textit{m/z} 200 – 1000 and \textit{m/z} 758.5694 was included in the target mass
list for MS\textsuperscript{2} selection.}
