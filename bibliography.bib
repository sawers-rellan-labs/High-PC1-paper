              MSiReader is presented, offering a multitude of newly added
              features critical to MSI analyses. MSiReader is a free,
              open-source, and vendor-neutral software written in the MATLAB
              platform and is capable of analyzing most common MSI data
              formats. A standalone version of the software, which does not
              require a MATLAB license, is also distributed. The newly
              incorporated data analysis features expand the utility of
              MSiReader beyond simple visualization of molecular distributions.
              The MSiQuantification tool allows researchers to calculate
              absolute concentrations from quantification MSI experiments
              exclusively through MSiReader software, significantly reducing
              data analysis time. An image overlay feature allows the
              incorporation of complementary imaging modalities to be displayed
              with the MSI data. A polarity filter has also been incorporated
              into the data loading step, allowing the facile analysis of
              polarity switching experiments without the need for data parsing
              prior to loading the data file into MSiReader. A quality
              assurance feature to generate a mass measurement accuracy (MMA)
              heatmap for an analyte of interest has also been added to allow
              for the investigation of MMA across the imaging experiment. Most
              importantly, as new features have been added performance has not
              degraded, in fact it has been dramatically improved. These new
              tools and the improvements to the performance in MSiReader v1.0

              measure across the proteome. Fortunately, protein thermostability
              is correlated with prokaryote optimal growth temperatures (OGTs),
              which can be predicted from genome features. Models that can
              predict temperature sensitivity across the prokaryote-eukaryote
              divide would help inform how eukaryotes adapt to elevated
              temperatures, such as those predicted by climate change models.
              In this study we test whether prediction models can cross the
              prokaryote-eukaryote divide to predict protein stability in both
              prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We compare models built using a) the
              whole proteome, b) Pfam domains, and c) individual amino acid
              residues. Proteome-wide models accurately predict prokaryote
              optimal growth temperatures (r2 up to 0.93), while site-specific
              models demonstrate that nearly half of the proteome is associated
              with optimal growth temperature in both Archaea and Bacteria.
              Comparisons with the small number of eukaryotes with temperature
              sensitivity data suggest that site-specific models are the most
              transferable across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide. Using the
              site-specific models, we evaluated temperature sensitivity for
              323,850 amino acid residues in 2,088 Pfam domain clusters in
              Archaea and Bacteria species separately. 59.0\% of tested
              residues are significantly associated with OGT in Archaea and
              75.2\% of tested residues are significantly associated with OGT
              in Bacteria species at a 5\% false discovery rate. These models
              make it possible to identify which Pfam domains and amino acid
              residues are involved in temperature adaptation and facilitate

              across organelles are consistent and highly significant between
              species, with cytosolic proteins having the largest range of
              predicted Pfam stabilities and a long tail of highly-stable
              ribosomal proteins. Pfam adaptation in leaf and root organs
              varies between species, and maize root proteins have more
              low-temperature Pfam domains than do Arabidopsis or poplar root
              proteins. Both poplar and maize populations have an excess of
              low-temperature mutations in Pfam domains, but only the mutations
              identified in poplar accessions have a negative effect on Pfam
              temperature adaptation overall. These Pfam domain adaptation
              profiles provide insight into how different plant structures
              adapt to their surrounding environment and can help inform
              breeding or protein editing strategies to produce heat-tolerant

  abstract = "Domains are present in every natural membrane. They are
              characterized by a distinctive protein and/or lipid composition.
              Their size is highly variable from the nano- to the micrometer
              scale. The domains confer specific properties to the membrane
              leading to original structure and function. The determinants
              leading to domain organization are therefore important but remain
              obscure. This review presents how the ability of lipids to
              organize into hexagonal II or lamellar phases can promote
              particular local structures within membranes. Since biological
              membranes are composed of a mixture of lipids, each with
              distinctive biophysical properties, lateral and transversal
              sorting of lipids can promote creation of domains inside the
              membrane through local modulation of the lipid phase. Lipid
              biophysical properties have been characterized for long based on
              in vitro analyses using non-natural lipid molecules; their
              re-examinations using natural lipids might open interesting

              the potential for more extreme temperature events will impact
              plant productivity. Pollination is one of the most sensitive
              phenological stages to temperature extremes across all species
              and during this developmental stage temperature extremes would
              greatly affect production. Few adaptation strategies are
              available to cope with temperature extremes at this developmental
              stage other than to select for plants which shed pollen during
              the cooler periods of the day or are indeterminate so flowering
              occurs over a longer period of the growing season. In controlled
              environment studies, warm temperatures increased the rate of
              phenological development; however, there was no effect on leaf
              area or vegetative biomass compared to normal temperatures. The
              major impact of warmer temperatures was during the reproductive

              significantly reduced by as much as 80−90\% from a normal

              lipids (LPCs) on
              1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC)
              lipid membranes by use of isothermal titration calorimetry and
              vesicle fluctuation analysis. The membrane partition coefficient
              (K) and critical micelle concentration (cmc) are determined by
              isothermal titration calorimetry and found to obey an inverse
              proportionality relation (cmc.K approximately 0.05-0.3). The
              partition coefficient and critical micelle concentration are used
              for the analysis of the effect of LPCs on the membrane bending

              increasing LPC acyl-chain length; and 2), that the degree of
              acyl-chain mismatch between LPC and POPC determines the magnitude

Here, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and data on numerous environmental variables to describe the genetic basis of local adaptation in 21 populations of teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize. We found complex hierarchical genetic structure created by altitude, dispersal events, and admixture among subspecies, which complicated identiï¬cation of locally beneï¬cial alleles. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium revealed four large putative inversion polymorphisms showing clinal patterns of frequency. Population differentiation and environmental correlations suggest that both inversions and intergenic polymorphisms are involved in local adaptation.},

              the lethal G$\beta$ phenotype and also identified a maize
              G$\beta$ allele with weak autoimmune responses but strong
              development phenotypes. Using these tools, we show that G$\beta$
              controls meristem size in maize, acting epistatically with G
              protein $\alpha$ subunit gene (G$\alpha$), suggesting that
              G$\beta$ and G$\alpha$ function in a common signaling complex.
              Furthermore, we used an association study to show that natural
              variation in G$\beta$ influences maize kernel row number, an
              important agronomic trait. Our results demonstrate the dual role
              of G$\beta$ in immunity and development in a cereal crop and
              suggest that it functions in cross-talk between these competing
              signaling networks. Therefore, modification of G$\beta$ has the
              potential to optimize the trade-off between growth and defense
              signaling to improve agronomic production.",

These patterns of genetic repeatability provide insights into the factors that facilitate or constrain the diversity of genetic responses that contribute to adaptive evolution. A first step in studying such factors is to quantify the observed amount of repeatability relative to expectations under a null hypothesis. Here, we formulate a novel index to quantify the constraints driving the observed amount of repeated adaptation in pairwise contrasts based on the hypergeometric distribution, and then generalize this for simultaneous analysis of multiple lineages. This index is explicitly based on the probability of observing a given amount of repeatability by chance under a given null hypothesis and is readily compared among different species and types of trait. We also formulate an index to quantify the effective proportion of genes in the genome that have the potential to contribute to adaptation. As an example of how these indices can be used to draw inferences, we assess the amount of repeatability observed in existing datasets on adaptation to stress in yeast and climate in conifers. This approach provides a method to test a wide range of hypotheses about how different kinds of factors can facilitate or constrain the diversity of genetic responses observed during adaptive evolution.},

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The plant circadian clock orchestrates 24-hour
              rhythms in internal physiological processes to coordinate these
              activities with daily and seasonal changes in the environment.
              The circadian clock has a profound impact on many aspects of
              plant growth and development, including biomass accumulation and
              flowering time. Despite recent advances in understanding the
              circadian system of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the
              contribution of the circadian oscillator to important agronomic
              traits in Zea mays and other cereals remains poorly defined. To
              address this deficit, this study investigated the transcriptional
              landscape of the maize circadian system. RESULTS: Since
              transcriptional regulation is a fundamental aspect of circadian
              systems, genes exhibiting circadian expression were identified in
              the sequenced maize inbred B73. Of the over 13,000 transcripts
              examined, approximately 10 percent displayed circadian expression
              patterns. The majority of cycling genes had peak expression at
              subjective dawn and dusk, similar to other plant circadian
              systems. The maize circadian clock organized co-regulation of
              genes participating in fundamental physiological processes,
              including photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall
              biogenesis, and phytohormone biosynthesis pathways. CONCLUSIONS:
              Circadian regulation of the maize genome was widespread and key
              genes in several major metabolic pathways had circadian
              expression waveforms. The maize circadian clock coordinated
              transcription to be coincident with oncoming day or night, which
              was consistent with the circadian oscillator acting to prepare
              the plant for these major recurring environmental changes. These
              findings highlighted the multiple processes in maize plants under
              circadian regulation and, as a result, provided insight into the
              important contribution this regulatory system makes to agronomic
              traits in maize and potentially other C4 plant species.",

              in mammals, however, whose functions in plants remain largely

              Subcellular localization analysis confirmed the signal peptide is
              indispensable for spPLD secretion into the extracellular spaces,

              evolution and niche expansion. Here we evaluate these opposing
              selection forces on introgressed ancestry between maize (Zea mays
              ssp. mays) and its wild teosinte relative, mexicana (Zea mays
              ssp. mexicana). Introgression from ecologically diverse teosinte
              may have facilitated maize's global range expansion, in
              particular to challenging high elevation regions (> 1500 m). We
              generated low-coverage genome sequencing data for 348 maize and
              mexicana individuals to evaluate patterns of introgression in 14
              sympatric population pairs, spanning the elevational range of
              mexicana, a teosinte endemic to the mountains of Mexico. While
              recent hybrids are commonly observed in sympatric populations and
              mexicana demonstrates fine-scale local adaptation, we find that
              the majority of mexicana ancestry tracts introgressed into maize
              over 1000 generations ago. This mexicana ancestry seems to have
              maintained much of its diversity and likely came from a common
              ancestral source, rather than contemporary sympatric populations,
              resulting in relatively low FST between mexicana ancestry tracts
              sampled from geographically distant maize populations.
              Introgressed mexicana ancestry in maize is reduced in
              lower-recombination rate quintiles of the genome and around
              domestication genes, consistent with pervasive selection against
              introgression. However, we also find mexicana ancestry increases
              across the sampled elevational gradient and that high
              introgression peaks are most commonly shared among high-elevation
              maize populations, consistent with introgression from mexicana
              facilitating adaptation to the highland environment. In the other
              direction, we find patterns consistent with adaptive and clinal
              introgression of maize ancestry into sympatric mexicana at many
              loci across the genome, suggesting that maize also contributes to
              adaptation in mexicana, especially at the lower end of its
              elevational range. In sympatric maize, in addition to high
              introgression regions we find many genomic regions where
              selection for local adaptation maintains steep gradients in
              introgressed mexicana ancestry across elevation, including at
              least two inversions: the well-characterized 14 Mb Inv4m on
              chromosome 4 and a novel 3 Mb inversion Inv9f surrounding the
              macrohairless1 locus on chromosome 9. Most outlier loci with high
              mexicana introgression show no signals of sweeps or local
              sourcing from sympatric populations and so likely represent
              ancestral introgression sorted by selection, resulting in
              correlated but distinct outcomes of introgression in different

              low-temperature stress include changes to the types and
              desaturation levels of membrane lipids, though the precise lipids
              affected tend to vary by species. Regulation of membrane dynamics
              and other low-temperature tolerance factors are controlled by
              both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here,
              we review low-temperature induced changes in both membrane lipid
              composition and gene transcription across multiple related plant
              species with differing degrees of low-temperature tolerance. We
              attempt to define a core set of changes for transcripts and
              lipids across species and treatment variations. Some responses
              appear to be consistent across all species for which data are
              available, while many others appear likely to be species or

However, so far no method has been developed to assess statistical significance of intersections among three or more sets. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches for visualization of multi-set intersections are not scalable. Here, we first developed a theoretical framework for computing the statistical distributions of multi-set intersections based upon combinatorial theory and then accordingly designed a procedure to efficiently calculate the exact probabilities of multi-set intersections. We further developed multiple efficient and scalable techniques to visualize multi-set intersections and the corresponding intersection statistics. We implemented both the theoretical framework and the visualization techniques in a unified R software package, SuperExactTest. We demonstrated the utility of SuperExactTest through an intensive simulation study and a comprehensive analysis of seven independently curated cancer gene sets as well as six disease or trait associated gene sets identified by genome-wide association studies. We expect SuperExactTest developed by this study will have a broad range of applications in scientific data analysis in many disciplines.},

              mapped in maize, their underlying molecular mechanisms and roles
              in adaptation remain largely unknown. Here, we report the
              identification and characterization of MADS-box transcription
              factor ZmMADS69 that functions as a flowering activator through
              the ZmRap2.7-ZCN8 regulatory module and contributes to
              adaptation. We show that ZmMADS69 underlies a quantitative trait
              locus controlling the difference in flowering time between maize
              and its wild ancestor, teosinte. Maize ZmMADS69 allele is
              expressed at a higher level at floral transition and confers
              earlier flowering than the teosinte allele under long days and
              short days. Overexpression of ZmMADS69 causes early flowering,
              while a transposon insertion mutant of ZmMADS69 exhibits delayed
              flowering. ZmMADS69 shows pleiotropic effects for multiple traits
              of agronomic importance. ZmMADS69 functions upstream of the
              flowering repressor ZmRap2.7 to downregulate its expression,
              thereby relieving the repression of the florigen gene ZCN8 and
              causing early flowering. Population genetic analyses showed that
              ZmMADS69 was a target of selection and may have played an

              knockout mutant (plb1plb2plb3; plb123) nor over-expression of
              phospholipase Bs (PLBs) result in a phenotype different from wild
              type. In performing experiments to characterize candidate plant
              phospholipase (PLA) genes, we found, surprisingly, that ectopic
              expression of either of two different A. thaliana PLA2 or PLA1
              genes in the yeast plb123 mutant completely inhibited cell
              growth. We proposed that while PLBs might not be essential for
              growth and metabolism of yeast cells, they may play an important
              role in cell survival by metabolizing excess intracellular
              lysophospholipids. To test our hypothesis, we overexpressed a
              plant phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in both WT and plb123 cells,
              producing a pool of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPtdCho) in both
              transformants. In \textsuperscript{14}C acetate labeling experiments, WT cells were
              able to catabolize the resultant labeled lysoPtdCho, preventing
              accumulation, and the cells grew normally. In contrast, in the
              triple plb123 mutant PLA2 transformant, lysoPtDCho accumulated
              more than 4-fold to a toxic level, inhibiting cell growth.
              However, this growth inhibition was complemented by co-expression
              of either PLB1, PLB2 or PLB3 in the plb123 triple mutant already
              expressing the plant PLA2. Furthermore, in labeling experiments,
              the rescued cells exhibited a 60-75\% reduction in 14C-lysoPtdCho
              build-up compared to plb123PLA2 cells. Our data provides
              conclusive evidence that yeast PLBs can metabolize intracellular
              lysoPtdCho produced by plant PLA2 overexpression in yeast. Our
              experiments indicate the utility of ectopic plant phospholipase A

              domestication and initial dispersals out of Mexico into Central
              and South America has become more clear due to molecular and
              multiproxy archaeobotanical research, important problems remain.
              Among them is the paucity of information on maize's early
              morphological evolution and racial diversification brought about
              in part by the poor preservation of macrofossils dating to the
              pre-5000 calibrated years before the present period from obligate
              dispersal routes located in the tropical forest. We report newly

              that shed significant light on the chronology, land race
              evolution, and cultural contexts associated with the crop's early
              movements into South America and adaptation to new environments.
              The evidence comes from the coastal Peruvian sites of Paredones
              and Huaca Prieta, Peru; dates from the middle and late preceramic
              and early ceramic periods (between ca. 6700 and 3000 calibrated
              years before the present); and constitutes some of the earliest
              known cobs, husks, stalks, and tassels. The macrobotanical record
              indicates that a diversity of racial complexes characteristic of

              Here we document the domestication of Oryza sp. wild rice by the
              mid-Holocene residents of the Monte Castelo shell mound starting
              at approximately 4,000 cal. yr BP, evidenced by increasingly

              animal's ability to find food, escape predators, or survive
              extreme conditions. At high altitude, where low O2 availability
              and persistent cold prevail, maximum metabolic heat production
              (thermogenesis) is an aerobic performance trait that is closely
              linked to survival. Understanding how thermogenesis evolves to
              enhance survival at high altitude will yield insight into the
              links between physiology, performance, and fitness. Recent work
              in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) has shown that adult mice
              native to high altitude have higher thermogenic capacities under
              hypoxia compared with lowland conspecifics, but that developing
              high-altitude pups delay the onset of thermogenesis. This finding
              suggests that natural selection on thermogenic capacity varies
              across life stages. To determine the mechanistic cause of this
              ontogenetic delay, we analyzed the transcriptomes of
              thermoeffector organs-brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle-in
              developing deer mice native to low and high altitude. We
              demonstrate that the developmental delay in thermogenesis is
              associated with adaptive shifts in the expression of genes
              involved in nervous system development, fuel/O2 supply, and
              oxidative metabolism pathways. Our results demonstrate that
              selection has modified the developmental trajectory of the
              thermoregulatory system at high altitude and has done so by
              acting on the regulatory systems that control the maturation of
              thermoeffector tissues. We suggest that the cold and hypoxic
              conditions of high altitude force a resource allocation tradeoff,
              whereby limited energy is allocated to developmental processes
              such as growth, versus active thermogenesis, during early

              range across China to uncover the genetic basis for adaptation to
              high-altitude hypoxia. Our genome dataset includes 65 lowland
              animals across ten Chinese native breeds, 61 horses living at
              least 3,300 meters above sea level across seven locations along
              Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, as well as 7 Thoroughbred and 5
              Przewalski's horses added for comparison. We find that Tibetan
              horses do not descend from Przewalski's horses but were most
              likely introduced from a distinct horse lineage, following the
              emergence of pastoral nomadism in Northwestern China ∼3,700 years

              showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each
              chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown
              function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups
              of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were
              examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have
              been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four
              population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting
              signatures of natural selection, we identified
              selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two

              Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from
              one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive
              natural selection in different genes or gene regions.
              Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in
              cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows
              evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans.
              However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between
              the two populations. Our results indicate that several key
              HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation
              to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different
              chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to

  abstract    = "Abstract?Combining individual p-values to aggregate multiple
                 small effects has a long-standing interest in statistics,
                 dating back to the classic Fisher?s combination test. In
                 modern large-scale data analysis, correlation and sparsity are
                 common features and efficient computation is a necessary
                 requirement for dealing with massive data. To overcome these
                 challenges, we propose a new test that takes advantage of the
                 Cauchy distribution. Our test statistic has a simple form and
                 is defined as a weighted sum of Cauchy transformation of
                 individual p-values. We prove a nonasymptotic result that the
                 tail of the null distribution of our proposed test statistic
                 can be well approximated by a Cauchy distribution under
                 arbitrary dependency structures. Based on this theoretical
                 result, the p-value calculation of our proposed test is not
                 only accurate, but also as simple as the classic z-test or
                 t-test, making our test well suited for analyzing massive
                 data. We further show that the power of the proposed test is
                 asymptotically optimal in a strong sparsity setting. Extensive
                 simulations demonstrate that the proposed test has both strong
                 power against sparse alternatives and a good accuracy with
                 respect to p-value calculations, especially for very small
                 p-values. The proposed test has also been applied to a

  abstract = "Higher plants use multiple perceptive measures to coordinate
              flowering time with environmental and endogenous cues.
              Physiological studies show that florigen is a mobile factor that
              transmits floral inductive signals from the leaf to the shoot
              apex. Arabidopsis FT protein is widely regarded as the archetype
              florigen found in diverse plant species, particularly in plants
              that use inductive photoperiods to flower. Recently, a large
              family of FT homologues in maize, the Zea CENTRORADIALIS (ZCN)
              genes, was described, suggesting that maize also contains
              FT-related proteins that act as a florigen. The product of one
              member of this large family, ZCN8, has several attributes that
              make it a good candidate as a maize florigen. Mechanisms
              underlying the floral transition in maize are less well
              understood than those of other species, partly because flowering
              in temperate maize is dependent largely on endogenous signals.
              The maize indeterminate1 (id1) gene is an important regulator of
              maize autonomous flowering that acts in leaves to mediate the
              transmission or production of florigenic signals. This study
              finds that id1 acts upstream of ZCN8 to control its expression,
              suggesting a possible new link to flowering in day-neutral maize.
              Moreover, in teosinte, a tropical progenitor of maize that
              requires short-day photoperiods to induce flowering, ZCN8 is
              highly up-regulated in leaves under inductive photoperiods.
              Finally, vascular-specific expression of ZCN8 in Arabidopsis
              complements the ft-1 mutation, demonstrating that leaf-specific
              expression of ZCN8 can induce flowering. These results suggest
              that ZCN8 may encode a florigen that integrates both endogenous
              and environmental signals in maize.",

                 of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first
                 generation of hash table-based methods has been developed,
                 including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough
                 to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ
                 does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which
                 makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels
                 may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when
                 the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of
                 individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment
                 tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on
                 backward search with Burrows--Wheeler Transform (BWT), to
                 efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large
                 reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing
                 mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g.
                 from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from
                 AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data
                 suggest that BWA is ∼10--20$\times$ faster than MAQ, while
                 achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment

                 also act as signaling molecules. Little is known about how
                 plants sense changes in soil nutrient concentrations. Previous
                 studies showed that T101-phosphorylated CHL1 is a
                 high-affinity nitrate transporter, whereas
                 T101-dephosphorylated CHL1 is a low-affinity transporter. In
                 this study, analysis of an uptake- and sensing-decoupled

                 nitrate sensor. Primary nitrate responses in CHL1T101D and
                 CHLT101A transgenic plants showed that phosphorylated and
                 dephosphorylated CHL1 lead to a low- and high-level response,

                 response. Thus, CHL1 uses dual-affinity binding and a
                 phosphorylation switch to sense a wide range of nitrate

              However, the specific genetic variants and traits that underlie
              this adaptation are not known. We created two families
              segregating for the standard and inverted haplotypes of Inv4m in
              a common genetic background and measured gene expression effects
              associated with the inversion across 9 tissues in two
              experimental conditions. With these data, we quantified both the
              global transcriptomic effects of the highland Inv4m haplotype,
              and the local cis-regulatory variation present within the locus.
              We found diverse physiological effects of Inv4m across the 9
              tissues, including a strong effect on the expression of genes
              involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast physiology. Although
              we could not confidently identify the causal alleles within
              Inv4m, this research accelerates progress towards understanding
              this inversion and will guide future research on these important
              genomic features.",

  abstract = "Background: The spread of maize cultivation to the highlands of
              central Mexico was accompanied by substantial introgression from
              the endemic wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana, prompting the
              hypothesis that the transfer of beneficial variation facilitated
              local adaptation. Methods: We used whole-genome sequence data to
              map regions of Zea mays ssp. mexicana introgression in three
              Mexican highland maize individuals. We generated a genetic
              linkage map and performed Quantitative Trait Locus mapping in an
              F2 population derived from a cross between lowland and highland
              maize individuals. Results: Introgression regions ranged in size
              from several hundred base pairs to Megabase-scale events. Gene
              density within introgression regions was comparable to the genome
              as a whole, and over 1,000 annotated genes were located within
              introgression events. Quantitative Trait Locus mapping identified
              a small number of loci linked to traits characteristic of Mexican
              highland maize. Discussion: Although there was no strong evidence
              to associate quantitative trait loci with regions of
              introgression, we nonetheless identified many Mexican highland
              alleles of introgressed origin that carry potentially functional
              sequence variants. The impact of introgression on stress
              tolerance and yield in the highland environment remains to be
              fully characterized.",

              world within a framework of adaptation, inspired perhaps by the
              power of natural selection to produce fitness advantages that
              drive population persistence and biological diversity. In
              contrast, evolution has rarely been studied through the lens of
              adaptation's complement, maladaptation. This contrast is
              surprising because maladaptation is a prevalent feature of
              evolution: population trait values are rarely distributed
              optimally; local populations often have lower fitness than
              imported ones; populations decline; and local and global
              extinctions are common. Yet we lack a general framework for
              understanding maladaptation; for instance in terms of
              distribution, severity, and dynamics. Similar uncertainties apply
              to the causes of maladaptation. We suggest that incorporating
              maladaptation-based perspectives into evolutionary biology would
              facilitate better understanding of the natural world. Approaches
              within a maladaptation framework might be especially profitable

              stem of the plant and a corresponding suppression of axillary
              branches). A striking example of this phenomenon is seen in maize
              (Zea mays spp. mays), which exhibits a profound increase in
              apical dominance compared with its probable wild ancestor,

              tb1 by transposon tagging and show here that it encodes a protein
              with homology to the cycloidea gene of snapdragon. The pattern of

              that tb1 acts both to repress the growth of axillary organs and
              to enable the formation of female inflorescences. The maize
              allele of tb1 is expressed at twice the level of the teosinte

              candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are
              related to population structure. Because population structure is
              ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is
              fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data
              and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based
              approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not
              require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first
              release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical
              approach and software implementation. We present results obtained
              with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for
              genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the
              package. When hierarchical population structure occurs,
              Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality
              statistic that was implemented in the first version of the
              package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other
              computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK,
              sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around
              a nominal false discovery rate set at 10\% with the exception of
              BayeScan that generates 40\% of false discoveries. We also find
              that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence
              of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we
              find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios
              of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt

                 repeats (CRISPR) technology have allowed targeted

                 objective was to determine if the selection gains from
                 targeted recombination are large enough to warrant the
                 development of targeted recombination technology in plants.
                 Genomewide marker effects for quantitative traits in two maize
                 ( L.) experiments were used to identify targeted recombination
                 points that would maximize the per-chromosome genetic gains in
                 a given cross. With nontargeted recombination in the
                 intermated B73 $\times$ Mo17 population, selecting the best
                 out of 180 recombinant inbreds led to a 7.1\% gain for
                 testcross yield. Having one targeted recombination on each of
                 the 10 maize chromosomes led to a predicted gain of 15.3\% for
                 yield. Targeted recombination therefore led to a predicted
                 relative efficiency () of (0.153 $\div$ 0.071) = 212\% of
                 targeted recombination compared with nontargeted
                 recombination. For the five other traits in the intermated B73
                 $\times$ Mo17 population and for four traits in 45 other maize
                 crosses, the values ranged from 105 to 600\%. The targeted
                 recombination points differed among traits and crosses.
                 Predicted gains increased when the number of targeted
                 recombinations per chromosome increased from one to two.
                 Overall, the results suggested that targeted recombination
                 could double the selection gains for quantitative traits in
                 maize and that the development of targeted recombination
                 technology is worthwhile. Empirical experiments with current

  abstract = "Gene expression differences between divergent lineages caused by
              modification of cis regulatory elements are thought to be
              important in evolution. We assayed genome-wide cis and trans
              regulatory differences between maize and its wild progenitor,
              teosinte, using deep RNA sequencing in F1 hybrid and parent
              inbred lines for three tissue types (ear, leaf and stem).
              Pervasive regulatory variation was observed with approximately
              70\% of ∼17,000 genes showing evidence of regulatory divergence
              between maize and teosinte. However, many fewer genes (1,079
              genes) show consistent cis differences with all sampled maize and
              teosinte lines. For ∼70\% of these 1,079 genes, the cis
              differences are specific to a single tissue. The number of genes
              with cis regulatory differences is greatest for ear tissue, which
              underwent a drastic transformation in form during domestication.
              As expected from the domestication bottleneck, maize possesses
              less cis regulatory variation than teosinte with this deficit
              greatest for genes showing maize-teosinte cis regulatory
              divergence, suggesting selection on cis regulatory differences
              during domestication. Consistent with selection on cis regulatory
              elements, genes with cis effects correlated strongly with genes

                 Quantitative Trait Loci (mQTL), genomic regions containing
                 genetic variation that control differences in metabolite

                 shifts in allele frequencies at many loci-a process called
                 polygenic adaptation. While a number of methods have been
                 developed to detect polygenic adaptation in human populations,
                 we lack clear strategies for doing so in many other systems.
                 In particular, there is an opportunity to develop new methods
                 that leverage datasets with genomic data and common garden

                 adaptation, and using a conditional test to control for

              differentiation--lessons from Arabidopsis thaliana",
  author   = "Kronholm, Ilkka and Loudet, Olivier and de Meaux, Juliette",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of molecular variation within and
              between populations is crucial to establish strategies for
              conservation as well as to detect the footprint of spatially
              heterogeneous selection. The traditional estimator of genetic
              differentiation (F(ST)) has been shown to be misleading if
              genetic diversity is high. Alternative estimators of F(ST) have
              been proposed, but their robustness to variation in mutation rate
              is not clearly established. We first investigated the effect of
              mutation and migration rate using computer simulations and
              examined their joint influence on Q(ST), a measure of genetic
              differentiation for quantitative traits. We further used
              experimental data in natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana
              to characterize the effect of mutation rate on various estimates
              of population differentiation. Since natural species exhibit
              various degrees of self-fertilisation, we also investigated the
              effect of mating system on the different estimators. RESULTS: If
              mutation rate is high and migration rate low, classical measures
              of genetic differentiation are misleading. Only Phi(ST), an
              estimator that takes the mutational distances between alleles
              into account, is independent of mutation rate, for all migration
              rates. However, the performance of Phi(ST) depends on the
              underlying mutation model and departures from this model cause
              its performance to degrade. We further show that Q(ST) has the
              same bias. We provide evidence that, in A. thaliana,
              microsatellite variation correlates with mutation rate. We
              thereby demonstrate that our results on estimators of genetic
              differentiation have important implications, even for species
              that are well established models in population genetics and
              molecular biology. CONCLUSIONS: We find that alternative measures
              of differentiation like F'(ST) and D are not suitable for
              estimating effective migration rate and should not be used in
              studies of local adaptation. Genetic differentiation should
              instead be measured using an estimator that takes mutation rate
              into account, such as Phi(ST). Furthermore, in systems where
              migration between populations is low, such as A. thaliana, Q(ST)
              < F(ST) cannot be taken as evidence for homogenising selection as
              has been traditionally thought.",

              predictable from Wright's FST, the effective population size and
              the mutational variance. The structure of quantitative genetic
              variance in a subdivided metapopulation can be predicted from
              results from coalescent theory, thereby allowing single-locus
              results to predict quantitative genetic processes. The expected
              total amount of additive genetic variance in a metapopulation of
              diploid individual is given by 2Ne sigma m2 (1 + FST), where FST
              is Wright's among-population fixation index, Ne is the eigenvalue
              effective size of the metapopulation, and sigma m2 is the
              mutational variance. The expected additive genetic variance
              within populations is given by 2Ne sigma e2(1-FST), and the
              variance among demes is given by 4FSTNe sigma m2. These results
              are general with respect to the types of population structure

              quantitative genetic variance among populations, QST, is shown to

              for all population structures, a value of QST greater than FST

                 changes during development and in response to environmental
                 cues often go beyond adjustments of lipid biosynthesis. When
                 lipids have to be removed to adjust the extent of membranes

                 has to be adjusted to alter the biophysical properties of
                 membranes, or lipid derived chemical signals have to be

                 focuses on glycerolipid acylhydrolases that remove acyl groups

                 remodeling and lipid-derived signal generation. One emerging

                 sequestered in lipid droplets during de novo triacylglycerol

                 signaling molecules and acylhydrolases are therefore often the

                 growth and development, providing cellular components and
                 modulating gene expression. To date, not only nitrogen
                 assimilatory genes but also a substantial number of genes with
                 other functions have been shown to be selectively regulated by
                 the availability of nitrogen. In terms of the communicating
                 substance(s) between root and shoot, accumulating evidence
                 suggests that nitrate itself is the primary signal molecule
                 triggering the activation of transcription of nitrate
                 assimilation and related genes. On the other hand, some of the
                 genes involved in photosynthesis, cell cycling and translation
                 machinery are also regulated, at least in part, by nitrate and
                 other nitrogen sources and, in some cases, the effect can be
                 mimicked by cytokinin treatment. Spatial and temporal studies
                 on the accumulation levels and the translocation of cytokinin
                 in response to nitrate replenishment in maize showed
                 subsequent accumulation of various cytokinin species in the
                 roots, xylem sap and leaves. In Arabidopsis thaliana,
                 trans-zeatin riboside-5'-monophosphate and/or trans-zeatin
                 riboside also accumulated in the roots in response to nitrate
                 resupply. These studies suggest that cytokinin metabolism and
                 translocation could be commonly modulated by nitrogen
                 availability in higher plants. Thus, in addition to nitrate,
                 cytokinin could be another root-to-shoot signal communicating
                 nitrogen availability.",

  author   = "Bernardo, Rex",
  abstract = "KEY MESSAGE: Bandwagons come in waves. A plant breeder, just like
              a surfer, needs to carefully choose which waves to be on. A
              bandwagon is an idea, activity, or cause that becomes
              increasingly fashionable as more and more people adopt it. In a
              1991 article entitled Bandwagons I Have Known, Professor N. W.
              Simmonds described several bandwagons that he encountered in his
              career, beginning with induced polyploidy and mutation breeding
              and ending with the then-new field of biotechnology. This article
              reviews and speculates about post-1990 bandwagons in plant
              improvement, including transgenic cultivars, quantitative trait
              locus (QTL) mapping, association mapping, genomewide (or genomic)
              selection, phenomics, envirotyping, and genome editing. The life
              cycle of a bandwagon includes an excitement phase of hype and
              funding; a realization phase when the initial hype is either
              tempered or the initial expectations are found to have been too
              low; and a reality phase when the useful aspects of a bandwagon
              become part of mainstream thinking and practice, or when an
              unsuccessful bandwagon is largely abandoned. During the
              realization phase, a new bandwagon that draws our attention and
              gives us renewed optimism typically arises. The most popular
              bandwagons, such as QTL mapping, are those for which the needed
              experimental resources are accessible, the required technical
              knowledge and skills can be easily learned, and the outputs can
              almost always be reported. The favorite bandwagon of any plant
              breeder has, in one way or another, resulted from Mendel's
              seminal discoveries 150 years ago. Our community of plant
              breeders needs to be continually diligent in welcoming new
              bandwagons, but also in hopping off from those that do not prove
              useful.",

                 steryl glucosides, and acylated steryl glucosides constituted
                 >50 mole\% of the total lipid in both NA and ACC plasma
                 membrane fractions. Glucocerebrosides containing hydroxy fatty
                 acids constituted the major glycolipid class of the plasma
                 membrane, accounting for 16 mole\% of the total lipid.
                 Phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine and
                 phosphatidylethanolamine with lesser amounts of
                 phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine,
                 and phosphatidylinositol, comprised only 32 mole\% of the
                 total lipid in NA samples. Following cold acclimation, free
                 sterols increased from 33 to 44 mole\%, while steryl
                 glucosides and acylated steryl glucosides decreased from 15 to
                 6 mole\% and 4 to 1 mole\%, respectively. Sterol analyses of
                 these lipid classes demonstrated that free beta-sitosterol
                 increased from 21 to 32 mole\% (accounting for the increase in
                 free sterols as a class) at the expense of sterol derivatives
                 containing beta-sitosterol. Glucocerebrosides decreased from
                 16 to 7 mole\% of the total lipid following cold acclimation.
                 In addition, the relative proportions of associated hydroxy
                 fatty acids, including 22:0 (h), 24:0 (h), 22:1 (h), and 24:1
                 (h), were altered. The phospholipid content of the plasma
                 membrane fraction increased to 42 mole\% of the total lipid
                 following cold acclimation. Although the relative proportions
                 of the individual phospholipids did not change appreciably
                 after cold acclimation, there were substantial differences in
                 the molecular species. Di-unsaturated molecular species
                 (18:2/18:2, 18:2/18:3, 18:3/18:3) of phosphatidylcholine and
                 phosphatidylethanolamine increased following acclimation.
                 These results demonstrate that cold acclimation results in
                 substantial changes in the lipid composition of the plasma
                 membrane.",

                 genetic variants. Recently, pathway-based approaches have been

                 To integrate the actions of the nitrogen signal at the whole
                 plant level, plants use multiple signaling routes that
                 communicate internal and external nitrogen status. One route
                 depends on nitrate itself and one uses cytokinin as a
                 messenger. Recent genome-wide research has shown that the
                 nitrate-specific signal regulates a wide variety of metabolic
                 processes including nitrogen and carbon metabolism, and
                 cytokinin biosynthesis. Cytokinin-mediated signaling is

                 types of images and species. We describe the Root System
                 Markup Language (RSML), which has been designed to overcome
                 two major challenges: (1) to enable portability of root
                 architecture data between different software tools in an easy
                 and interoperable manner, allowing seamless collaborative
                 work; and (2) to provide a standard format upon which to base
                 central repositories that will soon arise following the
                 expanding worldwide root phenotyping effort. RSML follows the
                 XML standard to store two- or three-dimensional image

                 botanical entities that are relevant at the scale of root
                 system architecture. An XML schema describes the features and
                 constraints of RSML, and open-source packages have been

                 additional set of 17 samples from the maize seedling and adult
                 root system. The entire dataset contains 4.6 billion mapped

  abstract    = "Divergent natural selection promotes local adaptation and can
                 lead to reproductive isolation of populations in contrasting
                 environments; however, the genetic basis of local adaptation
                 remains largely unresolved in natural populations. Local
                 adaptation might result from antagonistic pleiotropy, where
                 alternate alleles are favoured in distinct habitats, and
                 polymorphism is maintained by selection. Alternatively, under
                 conditional neutrality some alleles may be favoured in one
                 environment but neutral at other locations. Antagonistic
                 pleiotropy maintains genetic variation across the landscape;
                 however, there is a systematic bias against discovery of
                 antagonistic pleiotropy because the fitness benefits of local
                 alleles need to be significant in at least two environments.
                 Here, we develop a generally applicable method to investigate
                 polygenic local adaptation and identify loci that are the
                 targets of selection. This approach evaluates allele frequency
                 changes after selection at loci across the genome to
                 distinguish antagonistic pleiotropy from conditional
                 neutrality and deleterious variation. We investigate local
                 adaptation at the qualitative trait loci (QTL) level in field
                 experiments, in which we expose 177 F(6) recombinant inbred
                 lines and parental lines of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae) to
                 their parental environments over two seasons. We demonstrate
                 polygenic selection for native alleles in both environments,
                 with 2.8\% of the genome exhibiting antagonistic pleiotropy
                 and 8\% displaying conditional neutrality. Our study strongly
                 supports antagonistic pleiotropy at one large-effect flowering
                 phenology QTL (nFT): native homozygotes had significantly
                 greater probabilities of flowering than foreign homozygotes in
                 both parental environments. Such large-scale field studies are

              statistic, but does not establish which loci show such an excess
              or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral

              strength of local adaptation in maize landraces, we performed a
              reciprocal transplant experiment across an elevational gradient
              in Mexico. We grew 120 landraces, grouped into four populations
              (Mexican Highland, Mexican Lowland, South American Highland,
              South American Lowland), in Mexican highland and lowland common
              gardens and collected phenotypes relevant to fitness, as well as
              reported highland-adaptive traits such as anthocyanin
              pigmentation and macrohair density. 67k DArTseq markers were
              generated from field specimens to allow comparison between
              phenotypic patterns and population genetic structure. We found
              phenotypic patterns consistent with local adaptation, though
              these patterns differ between the Mexican and South American
              populations. While population genetic structure largely
              recapitulates drift during post-domestication dispersal, landrace
              phenotypes reflect adaptations to native elevation. Quantitative
              trait QST was greater than neutral FST for many traits, signaling
              divergent directional selection between pairs of populations. All
              populations exhibited higher fitness metric values when grown at
              their native elevation, and Mexican landraces had higher fitness
              than South American landraces when grown in our Mexican sites.
              Highland populations expressed generally higher anthocyanin
              pigmentation than lowland populations, and more so in the
              highland site than in the lowland site. Macrohair density was
              largely non-plastic, and Mexican landraces and highland landraces
              were generally more pilose. Analysis of $\delta$ 13C indicated
              that lowland populations may have lower WUE. Each population
              demonstrated garden-specific correlations between highland trait
              expression and fitness, with stronger positive correlations in
              the highland site. These results give substance to the long-held

              linkage disequilibrium (LD) is also known to be a strong
              signature of a selective sweep, we investigate how much
              statistical power is increased by the inclusion of information
              regarding LD. The expected pattern of LD is predicted by a
              genealogical approach. Both theory and simulation suggest that

                 element positioned 57 kb upstream of a CCT transcription
                 factor (ZmCCT9). The Harbinger-like element acts in cis to
                 repress ZmCCT9 expression to promote flowering under long
                 days. Knockout of ZmCCT9 by CRISPR/Cas9 causes early flowering

              wide association studies (GWAS) and to identify candidate genes
              involved in the regulation of complex trait variation. The
              pipeline provides probabilistic inference about a priori
              candidate genes using integrated information derived from
              genome-wide association signals, gene homology, and curated gene

              demonstrate the performance of PICARA using data for flowering
              time variation in maize - a key trait for geographical and
              seasonal adaption of plants. Among 406 curated flowering
              time-related genes from Arabidopsis, we identify 61 orthologs in
              maize that are significantly enriched for GWAS SNP signals,
              including key regulators such as FT (Flowering Locus T) and GI
              (GIGANTEA), and genes centered in the Arabidopsis circadian
              pathway, including TOC1 (Timing of CAB Expression 1) and LHY
              (Late Elongated Hypocotyl). In addition, we discover a regulatory
              feature that is characteristic of these a priori flowering time

              domesticated in a restricted area of Mexico but now displays one
              of the broadest cultivated ranges worldwide. Here, we sequenced
              67 genomes with an average sequencing depth of 18x to document
              routes of introduction, admixture and selective history of
              European maize and its American counterparts. To avoid the
              confounding effects of recent breeding, we targeted germplasm
              (lines) directly derived from landraces. Among our lines, we
              discovered 22,294,769 SNPs and between 0.9\% to 4.1\% residual

              segments of unexpectedly high rate of heterozygosity. These
              segments point to genes potentially involved in inbreeding

              variants. Genetic structuring and inferences of historical splits

              introductions, with modest bottleneck signatures. Our results

              contributed to the establishment of 3 groups at intermediate
              latitudes in North America and Europe. We combined
              differentiation- and diversity-based statistics to identify both

              These include genes/gene networks involved in flowering time,
              drought and cold tolerance, plant defense and starch properties.

                 major demographic events, including population size changes
                 associated with domestication and range expansion, and gene
                 flow with wild relatives. The interplay between demographic
                 history and selection has shaped diversity across maize
                 populations and genomes. RESULTS: We investigate these
                 processes using high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize
                 landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize,
                 and four wild teosinte individuals (Zea mays ssp.
                 parviglumis). Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that
                 maize experienced pronounced declines in effective population
                 size due to both a protracted domestication bottleneck and
                 serial founder effects during post-domestication spread, while
                 parviglumis in the Balsas River Valley experienced population
                 growth. The domestication bottleneck and subsequent spread led
                 to an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate
                 compared to the wild progenitor. This cost is particularly
                 pronounced in Andean maize, which has experienced a more
                 dramatic founder event compared to other maize populations.
                 Additionally, we detect introgression from the wild teosinte
                 Zea mays ssp. mexicana into maize in the highlands of Mexico,
                 Guatemala, and the southwestern USA, which reduces the
                 prevalence of deleterious alleles likely due to the higher
                 long-term effective population size of teosinte. CONCLUSIONS:
                 These findings underscore the strong interaction between
                 historical demography and the efficiency of selection and
                 illustrate how domesticated species are particularly useful
                 for understanding these processes. The landscape of
                 deleterious alleles and therefore evolutionary potential is
                 clearly influenced by recent demography, a factor that could
                 bear importantly on many species that have experienced recent
                 demographic shifts.",

However, the extent to which recurrent phenotypic adaptation has arisen via parallelism at the molecular level remains unresolved, as does the evolutionary origin of alleles underlying such adaptation. Here, we investigate genetic mechanisms of convergent highland adaptation in maize landrace populations and evaluate the genetic sources of recurrently selected alleles. Population branch excess statistics reveal strong evidence of parallel adaptation at the level of individual SNPs, genes and pathways in four independent highland maize populations, even though most SNPs show unique patterns of local adaptation. The majority of selected SNPs originated via migration from a single population, most likely in the Mesoamerican highlands. Polygenic adaptation analyses of quantitative traits reveal that alleles affecting flowering time are significantly associated with elevation, indicating the flowering time pathway was targeted by highland adaptation. In addition, repeatedly selected genes were significantly enriched in the flowering time pathway, indicating their significance in adapting to highland conditions. Overall, our study system represents a promising model to study convergent evolution in plants with potential applications to crop adaptation across environmental gradients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

              autotrophic growth of U.S. Corn Belt dent cultivars. At 13 C all
              plants grew heterotrophically utilizing seed reserves. However,
              major differences in the ability to grow autotrophicaly at 13 C
              existed among the genotypes studied. All genotypes containing
              germplasm from the high altitude Peruvian races ?San Geronimo,?
              ?Huancavelicano,? and ?Confite Puneno? were capable of
              autotrophic growth at l3 C as were genotypes from the CIMMYT
              (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo) Pool 5.
              ?Criollo die Toluca,? predominantly of the high altitude Mexican
              race Conico, and ?Bergenlaender,? of the high latitude Norllhern
              Flint race, per se, were unable to grow at 13 C. However, their
              crosses with W153R and the cross A619 ? Criollo de Toluca were
              able to grow autotrophically at this temperature. Differences in
              growth rates existed between A619 and WI53R in crosses. Overall,
              crosses with W153R had the highest growth rates and crosses with
              A619 the lowest. The three U.S. Corn Belt dent hybrids did not

abstract = {Summary Plants respond to abiotic stress through a variety of physiological, biochemical, and transcriptional mechanisms. Many genes exhibit altered levels of expression in response to abiotic stress, which requires concerted action of both cis- and trans-regulatory features. In order to study the variability in transcriptome response to abiotic stress, RNA sequencing was performed using 14-day-old maize seedlings of inbreds B73, Mo17, Oh43, PH207 and B37 under control, cold and heat conditions. Large numbers of genes that responded differentially to stress between parental inbred lines were identified. RNA sequencing was also performed on similar tissues of the F1 hybrids produced by crossing B73 and each of the three other inbred lines. By evaluating allele-specific transcript abundance in the F1 hybrids, we were able to measure the abundance of cis- and trans-regulatory variation between genotypes for both steady-state and stress-responsive expression differences. Although examples of trans-regulatory variation were observed, cis-regulatory variation was more common for both steady-state and stress-responsive expression differences. The genes with cis-allelic variation for response to cold or heat stress provided an opportunity to study the basis for regulatory diversity.},

              process genome-scale data as well as large sets of individual
              loci. It reads DNA alignments and single-nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP) data sets in most common formats, including those used by
              the HapMap, 1000 human genomes, and 1001 Arabidopsis genomes

              sliding windows. PopGenome offers a wide range of diverse
              population genetics analyses, including neutrality tests as well
              as statistics for population differentiation, linkage
              disequilibrium, and recombination. PopGenome is linked to

  abstract = "The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of homodimeric
              and heterodimeric molecules, expressed in all eukaryotic cells.
              In human cells, this family consists of seven distinct but highly
              homologous 14-3-3 isoforms. 14-3-3$\sigma$ is the only isoform
              directly linked to cancer in epithelial cells, which is regulated
              by major tumor suppressor genes. For each 14-3-3 isoform, we have
              1,000 peptide motifs with experimental binding affinity values.
              In this paper, we present a novel method for identifying peptide
              motifs binding to 14-3-3$\sigma$ isoform. First, we propose a
              sampling criteria to build a predictor for each new peptide
              sequence. Then, we select nine physicochemical properties of
              amino acids to describe each peptide motif. We also use
              auto-cross covariance to extract correlative properties of amino
              acids in any two positions. Finally, we consider elastic net to
              predict affinity values of peptide motifs, based on ridge
              regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
              (LASSO). Our method tests on the 1,000 known peptide motifs
              binding to seven 14-3-3 isoforms. On the 14-3-3$\sigma$ isoform,
              our method has overall pearson-product-moment correlation
              coefficient (PCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of
              0.84 and 252.31 for N-terminal sublibrary, and 0.77 and 269.13
              for C-terminal sublibrary. We predict affinity values of 16,000
              peptide sequences and relative binding ability across six
              permutated positions similar with experimental values. We
              identify phosphopeptides that preferentially bind to
              14-3-3$\sigma$ over other isoforms. Several positions on peptide
              motifs are in the same amino acid category with experimental
              substrate specificity of phosphopeptides binding to
              14-3-3$\sigma$. Our method is fast and reliable and is a general

              local adaptation of crops, whereby local landraces perform better
              than non-local ones under local conditions. By studying patterns
              of local adaptation we can better understand the degree of
              adaptation of landraces, phenotypic mechanisms driving that
              adaptation, and the plastic responses of adapted populations to
              environmental change. Studying these basic processes in crop
              centers of origin and diversity improves basic understanding of
              adaptive evolution and provides insight for existing farming

              collected and reciprocally transplanted in the field in two years
              along an elevational gradient in Chiapas, Mexico, we aimed to
              understand their degree of local adaptation, the distribution of

              differed across measures of fitness components and years.
              Flowering time variables showed more variability within

              operate at lipid-water interfaces enabled by a mobile lid domain

              hence responsible for catalytic activity. In pure aqueous media,
              the lid is predominantly closed, whereas in the presence of a
              hydrophobic layer, it is partially opened. Hence, the lid
              controls the enzyme activity. In the present review, we have
              classified lipases into different groups based on the structure
              of lid domains. It has been observed that thermostable lipases
              contain larger lid domains with two or more helices, whereas
              mesophilic lipases tend to have smaller lids in the form of a

              profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational
              expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an
              acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment
              Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal
              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
              distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
              20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
              algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These
              methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV
              hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM
              Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is
              implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package.
              Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV
              filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to
              unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more
              sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now

                 to identify the contribution of genetic, environmental and
                 lifestyle factors to the etiology of complex diseases.
                 Hypothesis-free testing of ratios between all possible
                 metabolite pairs in GWAS and MWAS has proven to be an
                 innovative approach in the discovery of new biologically
                 meaningful associations. The p-gain statistic was introduced
                 as an ad-hoc measure to determine whether a ratio between two
                 metabolite concentrations carries more information than the
                 two corresponding metabolite concentrations alone. So far,
                 only a rule of thumb was applied to determine the significance
                 of the p-gain. RESULTS: Here we explore the statistical
                 properties of the p-gain through simulation of its density and
                 by sampling of experimental data. We derive critical values of
                 the p-gain for different levels of correlation between
                 metabolite pairs and show that B/(2*$\alpha$) is a

                 the level of significance and B the number of tested
                 metabolite pairs. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the p-gain is a

                 statistically significant metabolite ratios in association
                 studies and provide a conservative significance cut-off for

                 history and the critical importance of a relatively small
                 number of crop plants to modern societies, we still know
                 little about adaptation under domestication. Here we focus on
                 efforts to identify the genes responsible for adaptation to
                 domestication. We start from a historical perspective, arguing
                 that Darwin's conceptualization of domestication and
                 unconscious selection provides valuable insight into the
                 evolutionary history of crops and also provides a framework to
                 evaluate modern methods used to decipher the genetic
                 mechanisms underlying phenotypic change. We then review these
                 methods, framing the discussion in terms of the
                 phenotype-genotype hierarchy. Top-down approaches, such as
                 quantitative trait locus and linkage disequilibrium mapping,
                 start with a phenotype of interest and use genetic analysis to
                 identify candidate genes. Bottom-up approaches, alternatively,
                 use population genetic analyses to identify potentially
                 adaptive genes and then rely on standard bioinformatics and
                 reverse genetic tools to connect selected genes to a
                 phenotype. We discuss the successes, advantages, and
                 challenges of each, but we conclude that bottom-up approaches
                 to understanding domestication as an adaptive process hold
                 greater promise both for the study of adaptation and as a
                 means to identify genes that contribute to agronomically
                 important traits.",

                 does metabolism respond to genetic, environmental or
                 phenotypic perturbations? Combining several metabolomics
                 assays can yield datasets for more than 800 structurally
                 identified metabolites. However, biological interpretations of
                 metabolic regulation in these datasets are hindered by
                 inherent limits of pathway enrichment statistics. We have
                 developed ChemRICH, a statistical enrichment approach that is
                 based on chemical similarity rather than sparse biochemical
                 knowledge annotations. ChemRICH utilizes structure similarity
                 and chemical ontologies to map all known metabolites and name
                 metabolic modules. Unlike pathway mapping, this strategy
                 yields study-specific, non-overlapping sets of all identified
                 metabolites. Subsequent enrichment statistics is superior to
                 pathway enrichments because ChemRICH sets have a
                 self-contained size where p-values do not rely on the size of
                 a background database. We demonstrate ChemRICH's efficiency on

                 introgression and local adaptation may contribute to this
                 pattern. Here, we analysed two teosinte subspecies, Zea mays
                 ssp. parviglumis and ssp. mexicana, to test whether their
                 divergence has occurred in the face of gene flow and to infer
                 which environmental variables have been important drivers of
                 their ecological differentiation. We generated 9,780 DArTseqTM
                 SNPs for 47 populations, and used an additional data set
                 containing 33,454 MaizeSNP50 SNPs for 49 populations. With

                 putative inversions. We therefore propose that genomic
                 differentiation in teosintes has occurred by a process of
                 adaptive divergence, with putative inversions contributing to
                 reduced gene flow between locally adapted populations.",

                 polymorphisms (SNPs) in 971 worldwide accessions that have
                 adapted to diverse agroclimatic conditions. Using this

                 structure with respect to geographic origin and morphological
                 type and identified patterns of ancient crop diffusion to
                 diverse agroclimatic regions across Africa and Asia. To better
                 understand the genomic patterns of diversification in sorghum,
                 we quantified variation in nucleotide diversity, linkage
                 disequilibrium, and recombination rates across the genome.
                 Analyzing nucleotide diversity in landraces, we find evidence
                 of selective sweeps around starch metabolism genes, whereas in
                 landrace-derived introgression lines, we find introgressions
                 around known height and maturity loci. To identify additional
                 loci underlying variation in major agroclimatic traits, we
                 performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on plant
                 height components and inflorescence architecture. GWAS maps
                 several classical loci for plant height, candidate genes for

                 allohexaploidy and self-incompatibility, developing molecular
                 markers for genetic analysis and molecular breeding has been
                 challenging. In the present study, using
                 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technology, 3436 genome-wide
                 markers discovered in a biparental population with 178 genets,
                 were mapped to 21 linkage groups (LG) corresponding to 21
                 chromosomes of IWG. Genomic prediction models were developed
                 using 3883 markers discovered in a breeding population
                 containing 1126 representative genets from 58 half-sib
                 families. High predictive ability was observed for seven
                 agronomic traits using cross-validation, ranging from 0.46 for
                 biomass to 0.67 for seed weight. Optimization results
                 indicated that 8 to 10 genets from each half-sib family can
                 form a good training population to predict the breeding value
                 of their siblings, and 1600 genome-wide markers are adequate
                 to capture the genetic variation in the current breeding
                 population for genomic selection. Thus, with the advances in
                 sequencing-based marker technologies, it was practical to
                 perform molecular genetic analysis and molecular breeding on a
                 new and challenging species like IWG, and genomic selection
                 could increase the efficiency of recurrent selection and
                 accelerate the domestication and improvement of IWG.",

                 relative to most b alleles in that it is expressed in the
                 aleurone layer of the seed. It is also expressed in a subset
                 of plant vegetative tissues. Transgenic maize plants
                 containing the B-Peru gene with the first 710 bases of
                 upstream sequence conferred the same levels of aleurone
                 expression as nontransgenic B-Peru plants, but no pigment was
                 made in vegetative tissues. Transient transformation assays in
                 aleurone tissue localized the aleurone-specific promoter to
                 the first 176 bases of the B-Peru upstream region and
                 identified two critically important regions within this
                 fragment. Mutation of either region alone reduced expression
                 greater than fivefold. Surprisingly, the double mutation
                 actually increased expression to twice the native promoter
                 level. Our results suggest that these two critical sequences,
                 which lie close together in the promoter, may form a negative
                 regulatory element. Several lines of evidence suggest that the
                 B-Peru promoter arose through the translocation of an existing
                 aleurone-specific promoter to the b locus. Immediately
                 upstream of the aleurone-specific promoter elements and in the
                 opposite orientation to the b coding sequence is a pseudogene
                 sequence with strong similarity to a known class of proteins.
                 Our findings that novel aleurone-specific promoter sequences
                 of the B-Peru transcription factor are found adjacent to part
                 of another gene in a small insertion are quite unexpected and

                 expression of genes that produce purple anthocyanin pigment.
                 Different b alleles are expressed in distinct tissues, causing
                 tissue-specific anthocyanin production. Understanding how
                 phenotypic diversity is produced and maintained at the b locus
                 should provide models for how other regulatory genes,
                 including those that influence morphological traits and
                 development, evolve. We have investigated how different levels
                 and patterns of pigmentation have evolved by determining the
                 phenotypic and evolutionary relationships between 18 alleles
                 that represent the diversity of b alleles in Zea mays.
                 Although most of these alleles have few phenotypic
                 differences, five alleles have very distinct tissue-specific
                 patterns of pigmentation. Superimposing the phenotypes on the
                 molecular phylogeny reveals that the alleles with strong and
                 distinctive patterns of expression are closely related to
                 alleles with weak expression, implying that the distinctive
                 patterns have arisen recently. We have identified apparent
                 insertions in three of the five phenotypically distinct
                 alleles, and the fourth has unique upstream restriction
                 fragment length polymorphisms relative to closely related
                 alleles. The insertion in B-Peru has been shown to be
                 responsible for its unique expression and, in the other two
                 alleles, the presence of the insertion correlates with the
                 phenotype. These results suggest that major changes in gene
                 expression are probably the result of large-scale changes in
                 DNA sequence and/or structure most likely mediated by
                 transposable elements.",

                 among individual crosses of plants and animals has a long and

                 combination of genetic, epigenetic, phenotypic, and
                 environmental factors. Although heterosis is known to be
                 governed by both dominant and epistatic gene action, its
                 expression is greatly influenced by nonlinear interaction
                 among epigenetic and phenotypic (phenomic) components. The
                 magnitude of heterosis is generally inferred post hoc by the
                 phenotypic performance of hybrids among laboriously made
                 individual crosses. The expression of dominance, however, is
                 nonlinear at the cellular level and obeys the principles
                 underlying metabolic flux. Then, is it possible to exploit
                 these relationships to predict heterosis? Vasseur and

                 powerful diagnostic and predictive tool in many branches of
                 science. Researchers in microbes, animal, food, medical and
                 plant science have generated a large number of targeted or
                 non-targeted metabolic profiles by using a vast array of
                 analytical methods (GC-MS, LC-MS, 1H-NMR….). Comprehensive
                 analysis of such profiles using adapted statistical methods
                 and modeling has opened up the possibility of using single or
                 combinations of metabolites as markers. Metabolic markers have
                 been proposed as proxy, diagnostic or predictors of key traits
                 in a range of model species and accurate predictions of
                 disease outbreak frequency, developmental stages, food sensory
                 evaluation and crop yield have been obtained. AIM OF REVIEW:
                 (i) To provide a definition of plant performance and metabolic
                 markers, (ii) to highlight recent key applications involving
                 metabolic markers as tools for monitoring or predicting plant
                 performance, and (iii) to propose a workable and
                 cost-efficient pipeline to generate and use metabolic markers
                 with a special focus on plant breeding. KEY MESSAGE: Using
                 examples in other models and domains, the review proposes that
                 metabolic markers are tending to complement and possibly
                 replace traditional molecular markers in plant science as
                 efficient estimators of performance.",

                 as they offer the potential to discover new alleles that could
                 be incorporated into modern maize lines. The compositional
                 analysis of B73 hybrids from the 25 NAM founders and 24 inbred
                 lines derived from landraces included measurements of
                 proximates (protein, fat, ash, and starch), fibers, minerals,
                 amino acids, fatty acids, tocopherols ($\alpha$-, $\gamma$-,
                 and $\delta$-), $\beta$-carotene, phytic acid, and raffinose.
                 Grain was harvested from a replicated trial in New York, USA.
                 For each data set (NAM and landrace) canonical discriminant
                 analysis allowed separation of distinct breeding groups
                 (tropical, temperate, flint, mixed/intermediate) within each
                 data set. Overall, results highlighted extensive variation in
                 all composition components assessed for both sets of hybrids.
                 The variation observed for some components within the
                 landraces may therefore be of value for increasing their

                 improve crop performance in low-P soils. To date, no QTLs

                 Maize's new morphology and adaptation to diverse environments

                 However, how the metabolome was reshaped since domestication
                 remains poorly understood. Here, we report a comprehensive
                 assessment of divergence in the seedling metabolome between
                 maize and teosinte. A total of 461 metabolites exhibited
                 significant divergence due to selection. Interestingly,
                 teosinte, tropical and temperate maize, representing major
                 stages of maize evolution, targeted distinct sets of
                 metabolites. Alkaloids, terpenoids and lipids were
                 specifically targeted in the divergence between teosinte and
                 tropical maize, while benzoxazinoids were specifically
                 targeted in the divergence between tropical and temperate
                 maize. To identify genetic factors controlling metabolic
                 divergence, we assayed the seedling metabolome of a large
                 maize-by-teosinte cross population. We show that the recent
                 metabolic divergence between tropical and temperate maize
                 tended to have simpler genetic architecture than the
                 divergence between teosinte and tropical maize. Through
                 integrating transcriptome data, we identified candidate genes
                 contributing to metabolic divergence, many of which were under

                 to AS3. S1 lines, S2 lines, and S2 testcrosses with an elite

                 the S1 and S2 lines from AS3. Mean grain yields of testcrosses
                 of NZS1 and AS3 were similar, but NZS1 testcrosses had higher

                 respect to quantitative data that enable interstudy

                 end, we used 126 identical human plasma samples and 29 quality
                 control samples from a nutritional intervention study. We
                 investigated lipidomic data acquisitions across nine different
                 MS instruments (1 single TOF, 1 Q/orbital ion trap, and 7 QTOF

                 concentrations for 307 unique lipids identified by accurate
                 mass, MS/MS spectral match, and retention times. Quantitative
                 results were highly comparable between the LC-MS platforms

                 platforms. Importantly, even the relative positions of
                 individual samples on the PLS-DA projections were identical.
                 The key for success in harmonizing results was to avoid ion

                 distribution of plant species and the growth and yield of crop
                 plants. Plants from temperate climates are able to increase
                 their freezing tolerance during exposure to low but
                 non-freezing temperatures in a process termed cold
                 acclimation. Damage to cellular membranes is the major cause
                 of freezing injury in plants, and membrane lipid composition
                 is strongly modified during cold acclimation. Forward and
                 reverse genetic approaches have been used to probe the role of
                 specific lipid-modifying enzymes in the freezing tolerance of
                 plants. In the present paper we describe an alternative
                 ecological genomics approach that relies on the natural
                 genetic variation within a species. Arabidopsis thaliana has a
                 wide geographical range throughout the Northern Hemisphere
                 with significant natural variation in freezing tolerance that
                 was used for a comparative analysis of the lipidomes of 15
                 Arabidopsis accessions using ultra-performance liquid
                 chromatography coupled to Fourier-transform mass spectrometry,
                 allowing the detection of 180 lipid species. After 14 days of
                 cold acclimation at 4°C the plants from most accessions had
                 accumulated massive amounts of storage lipids, with most of
                 the changes in long-chain unsaturated triacylglycerides, while
                 the total amount of membrane lipids was only slightly changed.
                 Nevertheless, major changes in the relative amounts of
                 different membrane lipids were also evident. The relative
                 abundance of several lipid species was highly correlated with

                 as for plant and animal breeding. However, the physiological
                 bases of heterosis remain debated. Moreover, empirical data in
                 various species have shown that diverse genetic and molecular
                 mechanisms are likely to explain heterosis, making it
                 difficult to predict its emergence and amplitude from parental
                 genotypes alone. In this study, we examined a model of
                 physiological dominance initially proposed by Sewall Wright to
                 explain the nonadditive inheritance of traits like metabolic
                 fluxes at the cellular level. We evaluated Wright's model for

                 rate and fruit number, using 450 hybrids derived from crosses

                 explaining up to 75\% of heterosis amplitude, while genetic
                 distance among parents at best explains 7\%. Thus, our
                 findings are consistent with Wright's model of physiological
                 dominance and suggest that the emergence of heterosis on plant

                 relationships between traits. Furthermore, our study
                 highlights the potential of a geometric approach of phenotypic

                 another allele at the same locus (Ga1-m), which is only
                 detectable by specific evaluation, allowing it to go
                 undetected in breeding lines, thus creating a scenario with

                 compact proteins folded around a tunnel-like hydrophobic
                 cavity, making them suitable for lipid binding and transport.
                 LTPs are encoded by large gene families in all land plants,
                 but they have not been identified in algae or any other
                 organisms. Thus, LTPs are considered key proteins for plant
                 survival on and colonization of land. LTPs are abundantly
                 expressed in most plant tissues, both above and below ground.
                 They are usually localized to extracellular spaces outside the
                 plasma membrane. Although the in vivo functions of LTPs remain
                 unclear, accumulating evidence suggests a role for LTPs in the
                 transfer and deposition of monomers required for assembly of
                 the waterproof lipid barriers, such as cutin and cuticular
                 wax, suberin, and sporopollenin, formed on many plant
                 surfaces. Some LTPs may be involved in other processes, such
                 as signaling during pathogen attacks. Here, we present the
                 current status of LTP research with a focus on the role of
                 these proteins in lipid barrier deposition and cell expansion.
                 We suggest that LTPs facilitate extracellular transfer of
                 barrier materials and adhesion between barriers and
                 extracellular materials. A growing body of research may
                 uncover the true role of LTPs in plants.",

                 proven to be an invaluable aid in both discovery and

                 approaches for examining effect profiles in Multi-G-Multi-E
                 analyses are either underpowered due to large degrees of

                 to imprecise modeling of the G and E effects, or lack of
                 capacity for modeling interactions between two factor-sets
                 (e.g., existing methods focus primarily on a single E factor).
                 In this work, we illustrate the issues encountered in
                 constructing kernels for investigating interactions between
                 two factor-sets, and propose a simple yet intuitive solution

                 ease-of-interpretation of classic regression. We also

                 structure, and interaction complexity. The largest power gain
                 was observed when the underlying effect structure involved
                 complex G$\times$E interactions; however, the proposed methods
                 have consistent, powerful performance when the effect profile
                 is simple or complex, suggesting that the proposed method

                 variants influence multiple distinct phenotypes. When
                 cross-phenotype effects exist, multivariate association
                 methods that consider pleiotropy are often more powerful than
                 univariate methods that model each phenotype separately.
                 Although several statistical approaches exist for testing
                 cross-phenotype effects for common variants, there is a lack
                 of similar tests for gene-based analysis of rare variants. In
                 order to fill this important gap, we introduce a statistical
                 method for cross-phenotype analysis of rare variants using a
                 nonparametric distance-covariance approach that compares
                 similarity in multivariate phenotypes to similarity in
                 rare-variant genotypes across a gene. The approach can
                 accommodate both binary and continuous phenotypes and further
                 can adjust for covariates. Our approach yields a closed-form
                 test whose significance can be evaluated analytically, thereby
                 improving computational efficiency and permitting application
                 on a genome-wide scale. We use simulated data to demonstrate
                 that our method, which we refer to as the Gene Association
                 with Multiple Traits (GAMuT) test, provides increased power

                 strategy for the analysis of large-scale genetic association
                 studies. The kernel machine (KM)-testing framework is a useful
                 approach that has been proposed for testing associations
                 between multiple genetic variants and many different types of
                 complex traits by comparing pairwise similarity in phenotype
                 between subjects to pairwise similarity in genotype, with
                 similarity in genotype defined via a kernel function. An
                 advantage of the KM framework is its flexibility: choosing
                 different kernel functions allows for different assumptions
                 concerning the underlying model and can allow for improved
                 power. In practice, it is difficult to know which kernel to
                 use a priori because this depends on the unknown underlying
                 trait architecture and selecting the kernel which gives the
                 lowest P-value can lead to inflated type I error. Therefore,
                 we propose practical strategies for KM testing when multiple
                 candidate kernels are present based on constructing composite
                 kernels and based on efficient perturbation procedures. We
                 demonstrate through simulations and real data applications
                 that the procedures protect the type I error rate and can lead
                 to substantially improved power over poor choices of kernels

                 (Fe) oxides in soil clays restricts P availability for crops
                 cultivated on highly weathered tropical soils, which are
                 common in developing countries. Hence, P deficiency becomes a
                 major obstacle for global food security. We used multi-trait
                 quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to study the genetic
                 architecture of P efficiency and to explore the importance of
                 root traits on sorghum grain yield on a tropical low-P soil.
                 RESULTS: P acquisition efficiency was the most important
                 component of P efficiency, and both traits were highly
                 correlated with grain yield under low P availability. Root
                 surface area was positively associated with grain yield. The
                 guinea parent, SC283, contributed 58\% of all favorable
                 alleles detected by single-trait mapping. Multi-trait mapping
                 detected 14 grain yield and/or root morphology QTLs. Tightly
                 linked or pleiotropic QTL underlying the surface area of fine
                 roots (1-2 mm in diameter) and grain yield were detected at
                 positions 1-7 megabase pairs (Mb) and 71 Mb on chromosome 3,
                 respectively, and a root diameter/grain yield QTL was detected
                 at 7 Mb on chromosome 7. All these QTLs were near sorghum
                 homologs of the rice serine/threonine kinase, OsPSTOL1. The
                 SbPSTOL1 genes on chromosome 3, Sb03g006765 at 7 Mb and
                 Sb03g031690 at 60 Mb were more highly expressed in SC283,
                 which donated the favorable alleles at all QTLs found nearby
                 SbPSTOL1 genes. The Al tolerance gene, SbMATE, may also
                 influence a grain yield QTL on chromosome 3. Another
                 PSTOL1-like gene, Sb07g02840, appears to enhance grain yield
                 via small increases in root diameter. Co-localization analyses
                 suggested a role for other genes, such as a sorghum homolog of
                 the Arabidopsis ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, phosphate 2
                 (PHO2), on grain yield advantage conferred by the elite
                 parent, BR007 allele. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic determinants
                 conferring higher root surface area and slight increases in
                 fine root diameter may favor P uptake, thereby enhancing grain
                 yield under low-P availability in the soil. Molecular markers
                 for SbPSTOL1 genes and for QTL increasing grain yield by
                 non-root morphology-based mechanisms hold promise in breeding

                 evolutionary biology. Integrating data for the genetic
                 architecture of traits from genome-wide association mapping
                 studies (GWAS) along with the development of new population
                 genetic methods for identifying selection in sequence data may
                 allow us to evaluate the roles of mutation-selection balance
                 and balancing selection in shaping genetic variation at
                 various scales. Here, we review the theoretical predictions
                 for genetic architecture and additional signals of selection
                 on genomic sequence for the loci that affect traits. Next, we
                 review how plant GWAS have tested for the signatures of
                 various selective scenarios. Limited evidence to date suggests
                 that within-population variation is maintained primarily by
                 mutation-selection balance while variation across the
                 landscape is the result of local adaptation. However, there
                 are a number of inherent biases in these interpretations. We
                 highlight these challenges and suggest ways forward to further

                 semi-arid tropics and is generally sensitive to
                 low-temperature stress. Early planting and use of minimum
                 tillage necessitate the development of sorghum hybrids with
                 early season cold tolerance. Genetic variability for cold
                 tolerance exists in sorghum and has been detected by early
                 planting under field conditions and by analysis of seeds and
                 plants under growth chamber conditions. There is limited
                 information on the efficiency of evaluating cold tolerance
                 under growth chamber conditions and the relationship with
                 field performance. The objectives of this study were to
                 quantify the variability of cold tolerance in commercial
                 hybrid seed lots under growth chamber conditions, to exam
                 different components of cold tolerance and their
                 relationships, and to evaluate the consistency of lab test
                 results with data from field tests. Thirty commercial hybrid
                 seed lots were evaluated by growing the entries under 15/10,
                 13/10, 11/8, and 25/20°C day/night temperature in a 13/11h

                 percentage, emergence index, shoot and root dry weight,
                 seedling height, and vigor score. Significant genotypic
                 differences were detected for all traits. Correlations among
                 the traits were significant and favorable, which confirmed
                 that simultaneous improvement of these traits should be
                 possible. The same seed lots were also evaluated in a
                 soil-free plate-based assay, in which percent germination, and
                 shoot and root elongation of the seed lots grown in dark at
                 15°C were measured. Results from both laboratory tests,
                 soil-based and plate-based, were correlated with data

                 Single-trait correlations between lab and field studies were

                 common traits, rank-summation index correlations and the
                 overlap of best entries, further provided strong support of

                 types of GT-free materials produce artemisinin, artemisinic
                 acid, and arteannuin B. Detailed IR-MALDESI image profiling

                 expanding into strikingly different temperate climates in
                 Eurasia and beyond. Here, we find elevated cold tolerance in
                 three distinct geographic regions: beyond the well-studied
                 non-African case, we show that populations from the highlands
                 of Ethiopia and South Africa have significantly increased cold
                 tolerance as well. We observe greater cold tolerance in
                 outbred versus inbred flies, but only in populations with
                 higher inversion frequencies. Each cold-adapted population
                 shows lower inversion frequencies than a closely-related
                 warm-adapted population, suggesting that inversion frequencies
                 may decrease with altitude in addition to latitude. Using the
                 FST-based ``Population Branch Excess'' statistic (PBE), we
                 found only limited evidence for parallel genetic
                 differentiation at the scale of ∼4 kb windows, specifically
                 between Ethiopian and South African cold-adapted populations.
                 And yet, when we looked for single nucleotide polymorphisms
                 (SNPs) with codirectional frequency change in two or three
                 cold-adapted populations, strong genomic enrichments were
                 observed from all comparisons. These findings could reflect an
                 important role for selection on standing genetic variation
                 leading to ``soft sweeps''. One SNP showed sufficient
                 codirectional frequency change in all cold-adapted populations
                 to achieve experiment-wide significance: an intronic variant
                 in the synaptic gene Prosap. Another codirectional outlier
                 SNP, at senseless-2, had a strong association with our cold
                 trait measurements, but in the opposite direction as
                 predicted. More generally, proteins involved in
                 neurotransmission were enriched as potential targets of
                 parallel adaptation. The ability to study cold tolerance
                 evolution in a parallel framework will enhance this classic

                 The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as
                 guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate

                 cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a
                 current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install

                   above that which can be gleaned from studying SNPs

                   association testing include weak effect sizes, correlation

                   Higher Criticism (GHC) test when signals in a SNP-set are
                   moderately sparse. We also provide an analytic p-value
                   calculation procedure for SNP-sets of any finite size. Using
                   this p-value calculation, we illustrate that the rejection
                   region for GBJ can be described as a compromise of those for
                   BJ and GHC. We develop an omnibus statistic as well, and we
                   show that this omnibus test is robust to the degree of
                   signal sparsity. An additional advantage of our method is
                   the ability to conduct inference using individual SNP
                   summary statistics from a genome-wide association study. We

              methodological pipeline to identify the signature of selection
              for molecular phenotypic traits (e.g., metabolites and
              transcripts). Following the approach, we show that a reduction in

              domestication of emmer (primary domestication). We also show that
              changes in the amino acid content due to selection mark the

                 drift cell at an elevated pressure compared with that
                 conventionally used. The ESI-IMS-TOF MS instrument consists of
                 an ESI source, an hourglass ion funnel used for ion
                 accumulation/injection into an 88 cm drift cell, followed by a

                 statistical models, which are used by GS to perform
                 predictions of candidate genotypes that were not phenotyped.
                 Because there is no universally better model for prediction
                 and models for each type of response variable are needed
                 (continuous, binary, ordinal, count, etc.), an active area of
                 research aims to develop statistical models for the prediction
                 of univariate and multivariate traits in GS. However, most of
                 the models developed so far are for univariate and continuous
                 (Gaussian) traits. Therefore, to overcome the lack of
                 multivariate statistical models for genome-based prediction by
                 improving the original version of the BMTME, we propose an

                 populations. However, no results of GS applied to maize
                 multi-parental populations have been reported so far. This
                 study is the first to show realized genetic gains of rapid
                 cycling genomic selection (RCGS) for four recombination cycles
                 in a multi-parental tropical maize population. Eighteen elite
                 tropical maize lines were intercrossed twice, and
                 self-pollinated once, to form the cycle 0 (C0) training
                 population. A total of 1000 ear-to-row C0 families was
                 genotyped with 955,690 genotyping-by-sequencing SNP markers;
                 their testcrosses were phenotyped at four optimal locations in
                 Mexico to form the training population. Individuals from
                 families with the best plant types, maturity, and grain yield
                 were selected and intermated to form RCGS cycle 1 (C1).
                 Predictions of the genotyped individuals forming cycle C1 were
                 made, and the best predicted grain yielders were selected as
                 parents of C2; this was repeated for more cycles (C2, C3, and
                 C4), thereby achieving two cycles per year. Multi-environment
                 trials of individuals from populations C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4,
                 together with four benchmark checks were evaluated at two

                 yield from C1 to C4 reached 0.225 ton ha-1 per cycle, which is
                 equivalent to 0.100 ton ha-1 yr-1 over a 4.5-yr breeding
                 period from the initial cross to the last cycle. Compared with
                 the original 18 parents used to form cycle 0 (C0), genetic
                 diversity narrowed only slightly during the last GS cycles (C3
                 and C4). Results indicate that, in tropical maize
                 multi-parental breeding populations, RCGS can be an effective
                 breeding strategy for simultaneously conserving genetic

                 genetic pathways, and networks on the risk of complex
                 diseases. These genetic constructs each contain multiple SNPs,
                 which are often correlated and function jointly, and might be
                 large in number. However, only a sparse subset of SNPs in a
                 genetic construct is generally associated with the disease of
                 interest. In this article, we propose the generalized higher
                 criticism (GHC) to test for the association between an SNP set
                 and a disease outcome. The higher criticism is a test
                 traditionally used in high-dimensional signal detection
                 settings when marginal test statistics are independent and the
                 number of parameters is very large. However, these assumptions
                 do not always hold in genetic association studies, due to
                 linkage disequilibrium among SNPs and the finite number of
                 SNPs in an SNP set in each genetic construct. The proposed GHC
                 overcomes the limitations of the higher criticism by allowing
                 for arbitrary correlation structures among the SNPs in an
                 SNP-set, while performing accurate analytic p-value
                 calculations for any finite number of SNPs in the SNP-set. We

                 existing SNP-set tests over a range of genetic regions with
                 varied correlation structures and signal sparsity. We apply

                 for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in
                 population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data
                 from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has
                 exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations
                 of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage
                 disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In
                 addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently
                 contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or
                 multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by
                 PLINK 1's primary data format. FINDINGS: To address these
                 issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for
                 PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9,
                 introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula:
                 see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and
                 Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements.
                 In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by
                 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle
                 datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an
                 extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support
                 for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and
                 reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our
                 planned second release (PLINK 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: The
                 second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic
                 improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first

                 to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years.
                 Most of them are very efficient for short reads but
                 inefficient or not applicable for reads >200 bp because the
                 algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short
                 queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some
                 sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others
                 are expected to become available soon. For longer reads,
                 hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only
                 choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower
                 than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit

                 with rice and wheat, responsible for more than one-half of all
                 calories consumed around the world. Increasing the yield and
                 stress tolerance of these crops is essential to meet the
                 growing need for food. The cost and speed of plant phenotyping
                 are currently the largest constraints on plant breeding
                 efforts. Datasets linking new types of high-throughput
                 phenotyping data collected from plants to the performance of
                 the same genotypes under agronomic conditions across a wide
                 range of environments are essential for developing new
                 statistical approaches and computer vision-based tools.
                 Findings: A set of maize inbreds-primarily recently off patent
                 lines-were phenotyped using a high-throughput platform at
                 University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These lines have been
                 previously subjected to high-density genotyping and scored for
                 a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 North
                 American states in 2 years by the Genomes 2 Fields Consortium.
                 A total of 485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral,
                 fluorescence, and thermal infrared photos has been released.
                 Conclusions: Correlations between image-based measurements and
                 manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of
                 quantifying variation in plant architecture using image data.
                 However, naive approaches to measuring traits such as biomass
                 can introduce nonrandom measurement errors confounded with
                 genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data
                 demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating
                 heritable phenotypes from high-throughput phenotyping data
                 with field data from different environments can reveal
                 previously unknown factors that influence yield plasticity.",

                 DNA polymorphisms - is a disruptive method that has widely
                 been adopted by animal and plant breeders to increase
                 productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of
                 molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts
                 or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex
                 traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing
                 the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex
                 regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between
                 the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics
                 data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced
                 in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we
                 proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a
                 high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to
                 indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute
                 relationship matrices for predicting complex traits, and
                 coined this new approach ``phenomic selection'' (PS). We
                 tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum
                 aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various
                 tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach
                 predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for
                 developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in
                 environments radically different from the one in which NIRS
                 were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and
                 provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is
                 theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does
                 not require any molecular information.",

                 blight and ear mold disease caused by Cochliobolus carbonum
                 race 1 (CCR1). Although it was the first disease-resistance
                 (DR) gene to be cloned, it remains a novelty because, instead
                 of participating in the plant recognition and response system
                 as most DR genes do, Hm1 disarms the pathogen directly. It
                 does so by encoding an NADPH-dependent reductase, whose
                 function is to inactivate Helminthosporium carbonum (HC)
                 toxin, an epoxide-containing cyclic tetrapeptide, which the
                 pathogen produces as a key virulence factor to colonize maize.
                 Although CCR1 is strictly a pathogen of maize, orthologs of
                 Hm1 and the HC-toxin reductase activity are present in the
                 grass family, suggesting an ancient and evolutionarily
                 conserved role of this DR trait in plants. Here, we provide
                 proof for such a role by demonstrating its involvement in
                 nonhost resistance of barley to CCR1. Barley leaves in which
                 expression of the Hm1 homologue was silenced became
                 susceptible to infection by CCR1, but only if the pathogen was
                 able to produce HC toxin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that
                 Hm1 evolved exclusively and early in the grass lineage. Given
                 the devastating ability of CCR1 to kill maize, these findings
                 imply that the evolution and/or geographical distribution of
                 grasses may have been constrained if Hm1 did not emerge.",

                 is correlated with habitat temperatures such that insects from

                 ecologically important, polygenic traits. We analysed
                 sequences from 25 genes representing 10 steps of the CT
                 synthesis pathway, which produces CTs used in defence and
                 lignins used for growth, in 12 individuals of European aspen
                 (Populus tremula). We compared these to homologs from P.
                 trichocarpa, to a control set of 77 P. tremula genes, to
                 genome-wide resequencing data and to RNA-seq expression
                 levels, in order to identify signatures of selection distinct
                 from those of demography. In Populus, pathway position exerts
                 a strong influence on the evolution of these genes.
                 Nonsynonymous diversity, divergence and allele frequency
                 shifts (Tajima's D) were much lower than for synonymous
                 measures. Expression levels were higher, and the direction of
                 selection more negative, for upstream genes than for those
                 downstream. Selective constraints act with increasing
                 intensity on upstream genes, despite the presence of multiple
                 paralogs in most gene families. Pleiotropy, expression level,
                 flux control and codon bias appear to interact in determining
                 levels and patterns of variation in genes of this pathway,
                 whose products mediate a wide array of ecological interactions
                 for this widely distributed species.",

  abstract    = "During the past decade, microevolution of intermediary
                 metabolism has become an important new research focus at the
                 interface between metabolic biochemistry and evolutionary
                 genetics. Increasing recognition of the importance of
                 integrative studies in evolutionary analysis, the rising
                 interest in 'evolutionary systems biology', and the
                 development of various 'omics' technologies have all
                 contributed significantly to this developing interface. The
                 present review primarily focuses on five prominent areas of
                 recent research on pathway microevolution: lipid metabolism
                 and life-history evolution; the electron transport system,
                 hybrid breakdown and speciation; glycolysis, alcohol
                 metabolism and population adaptation in Drosophila; chemostat
                 selection in microorganisms; and anthocyanin pigment
                 biosynthesis and flower color evolution. Some of these studies
                 have provided a new perspective on important evolutionary
                 topics that have not been investigated extensively from a
                 biochemical perspective (hybrid breakdown, parallel
                 evolution). Other studies have provided new data that augment
                 previous biochemical information, resulting in a deeper
                 understanding of evolutionary mechanisms (allozymes and
                 biochemical adaptation to climate, life-history evolution,
                 flower pigments and the genetics of adaptation). Finally,
                 other studies have provided new insights into how the function
                 or position of an enzyme in a pathway influences its
                 evolutionary dynamics, in addition to providing powerful
                 experimental models for investigations of network evolution.
                 Microevolutionary studies of metabolic pathways will
                 undoubtedly become increasingly important in the future
                 because of the central importance of intermediary metabolism
                 in organismal fitness, the wealth of biochemical data being
                 provided by various omics technologies, and the increasing

                 interactions are sensitive to misspecification of the

                 with binary phenotypes and rare variants, which bear less

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been
                 successful in identifying disease-associated genetic variants.
                 Recently, an increasing number of GWAS summary statistics have
                 been made available to the research community, providing
                 extensive repositories for studies of human complex diseases.
                 In particular, cross-trait associations at the genetic level
                 can be beneficial from large-scale GWAS summary statistics by
                 using genetic variants that are associated with multiple
                 traits. However, direct assessment of cross-trait associations
                 using susceptibility loci has been challenging due to the
                 complex genetic architectures in most diseases, calling for
                 advantageous methods that could integrate functional
                 interpretation and imply biological mechanisms. RESULTS: We
                 developed an analytical framework for systematic integration
                 of cross-trait associations. It incorporates two different
                 approaches to detect enriched pathways and requires only
                 summary statistics. We demonstrated the framework using 25
                 traits belonging to four phenotype groups. Our results
                 revealed an average of 54 significantly associated pathways
                 (ranged between 18 and 175) per trait. We further proved that
                 pathway-based analysis provided increased power to estimate
                 cross-trait associations compared to gene-level analysis.
                 Based on Fisher's Exact Test (FET), we identified a total of
                 24 (53) pairs of trait-trait association at adjusted pFET < 1
                 $\times$ 10- 3 (pFET < 0.01) among the 25 traits. Our
                 trait-trait association network revealed not only many
                 relationships among the traits within the same group but also
                 novel relationships among traits from different groups, which
                 warrants further investigation in future. CONCLUSIONS: Our
                 study revealed that risk variants for 25 different traits
                 aggregated in particular biological pathways and that these
                 pathways were frequently shared among traits. Our results
                 confirmed known mechanisms and also suggested several novel
                 insights into the etiology of multi-traits.",

                 in which the evidence for association exceeds the genome-wide
                 significance threshold is very small, and markers that do not
                 exceed this threshold are generally neglected. Classical
                 statistical analysis of these datasets in MS revealed genes
                 with known immunological functions. However, many of the
                 markers showing modest association may represent false
                 negatives. We hypothesize that certain combinations of genes
                 flagged by these markers can be identified if they belong to a
                 common biological pathway. Here we conduct a pathway-oriented
                 analysis of two GWAS in MS that takes into account all SNPs
                 with nominal evidence of association (P < 0.05). Gene-wise
                 P-values were superimposed on a human protein interaction

                 sub-networks of genes from several immunological pathways
                 including cell adhesion, communication and signaling.
                 Remarkably, neural pathways, namely axon-guidance and synaptic
                 potentiation, were also over-represented in MS. In addition to
                 the immunological pathways previously identified, we report

                 employed to identify genetic loci that regulate specific

                 variation to quantitative phenotypic outcomes typically
                 evaluate one or several traits at a time. Advances in high
                 throughput phenotyping now enable datasets which include
                 information on dozens or hundreds of traits scored across
                 multiple environments. Here, we develop an approach to use
                 data from many phenotypic traits simultaneously to identify
                 causal genetic loci. Using data for 260 traits scored across a
                 maize diversity panel, we demonstrate that a distinct set of
                 genes are identified relative to conventional genome wide
                 association. The genes identified using this many-trait
                 approach are more likely to be independently validated than
                 the genes identified by conventional analysis of the same
                 dataset. Genes identified by the new many-trait approach share
                 a number of molecular, population genetic, and evolutionary
                 features with a gold standard set of genes characterized

                 substantially stronger functional enrichments and

                 an oil content which is decreased by 30\%, and a strongly
                 increased ratio of 18:3/20:1, compared to wild type. Despite
                 lacking a functional DGAT1, AS11 still manages to make 70\% of
                 WT seed oil levels. Recently, it was demonstrated that in the
                 absence of DGAT1, PDAT1 was essential for normal seed
                 development, and is a dominant determinant in Arabidopsis TAG
                 biosynthesis. METHODS: Biochemical, metabolic and gene
                 expression studies combined with genetic crossing of selected
                 Arabidopsis mutants have been carried out to demonstrate the
                 contribution of Arabidopsis PDAT1 and LPCAT2 in the absence of
                 DGAT1 activity. RESULTS: Through microarray and RT-PCR gene
                 expression analyses of AS11 vs. WT mid-developing siliques, we
                 observed consistent trends between the two methods. FAD2 and
                 FAD3 were up-regulated and FAE1 down-regulated, consistent
                 with the AS11 acyl phenotype. PDAT1 expression was
                 up-regulated by ca 65\% while PDAT2 expression was
                 up-regulated only 15\%, reinforcing the dominant role of PDAT1
                 in AS11 TAG biosynthesis. The expression of LPCAT2 was
                 up-regulated by 50-75\%, while LPCAT1 expression was not
                 significantly affected. In vitro LPCAT activity was enhanced
                 by 75-125\% in microsomal protein preparations from
                 mid-developing AS11 seed vs WT. Co-incident homozygous
                 knockout lines of dgat1/lpcat2 exhibited severe penalties on
                 TAG biosynthesis, delayed plant development and seed set, even
                 with a functional PDAT1; the double mutant dgat1/lpcat1 showed
                 only marginally lower oil content than AS11. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Collectively, the data strongly support that in AS11 it is
                 LPCAT2 up-regulation which is primarily responsible for
                 assisting in PDAT1-catalyzed TAG biosynthesis, maintaining a

                 photoperiod-sensitive tropical inbreds. Whole-genome scans
                 were conducted by high-density genotyping of the populations,
                 which were phenotyped over 3 years in both short- and long-day
                 environments. Joint multiple population analysis identified
                 genomic regions controlling photoperiod responses in flowering

                 regions controlling photoperiod response across populations

                 domestication was the liberation of the kernel from the
                 hardened, protective casing that envelops the kernel in the
                 maize progenitor, teosinte. This evolutionary step exposed the
                 kernel on the surface of the ear, such that it could readily
                 be used by humans as a food source. Here we show that this key
                 event in maize domestication is controlled by a single gene
                 (teosinte glume architecture or tga1), belonging to the
                 SBP-domain family of transcriptional regulators. The factor
                 controlling the phenotypic difference between maize and
                 teosinte maps to a 1-kilobase region, within which maize and
                 teosinte show only seven fixed differences in their DNA

                 amino acid substitution and may affect protein function, and
                 the other six differences potentially affect gene regulation.
                 Molecular evolution analyses show that this region was the

                 evolutionary and food security implications of the scale and
                 scope under which campesinos produce maize. We gathered
                 official municipal-level data on maize production under
                 rainfed conditions and identified campesino agriculture as
                 occurring in municipalities with average yields of less than
                 or equal to 3 t ha-1 Environmental conditions vary widely in
                 those municipalities and are associated with a great diversity
                 of maize races, representing 85.3\% of native maize samples

                 different individual plants are subjected to evolution under

                 we mapped genomic regions controlling latitudinal and

                 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), where genome-wide genotype
                 data can be obtained for nearly any species. However, there
                 remains a need for imputation-free GBS methods for genotyping
                 large samples taken from heterogeneous populations of
                 heterozygous individuals. This requires that a number of
                 issues encountered with GBS be considered, including the
                 sequencing of nonoverlapping sets of loci across multiple GBS
                 libraries, a common missing data problem that results in low
                 call rates for markers per individual, and a tendency for
                 applicability only in inbred line samples with sufficient
                 linkage disequilibrium for accurate imputation. We addressed
                 these issues while developing and validating a new,
                 comprehensive platform for GBS. This study supports the notion
                 that GBS can be tailored to particular aims, and using Zea
                 mays our results indicate that large samples of unknown
                 pedigree can be genotyped to obtain complete and accurate GBS
                 data. Optimizing size selection to sequence a high proportion
                 of shared loci among individuals in different libraries and
                 using simple in silico filters, a GBS procedure was
                 established that produces high call rates per marker (>85\%)
                 with accuracy exceeding 99.4\%. Furthermore, by capitalizing
                 on the sequence-read structure of GBS data (stacks of reads),
                 a new tool for resolving local haplotypes and scoring phased
                 genotypes was developed, a feature that is not available in
                 many GBS pipelines. Using local haplotypes reduces the marker
                 dimensionality of the genotype matrix while increasing the
                 informativeness of the data. Phased GBS in maize also revealed
                 the existence of reproducibly inaccurate (apparent accuracy)

                 yields, farmers will need a suite of adaptation strategies,
                 and choice of strategy will depend on how the local to
                 regional climate is expected to change. Here we predict how
                 maize yield might change through the 21st century as compared
                 with late 20th century yields across Iowa, USA, a region
                 representing ideal climate and soils for maize production that
                 contributes substantially to the global maize economy. To
                 account for climate model uncertainty, we drive a dynamic
                 ecosystem model with output from six climate models and two
                 future climate forcing scenarios. Despite a wide range in the
                 predicted amount of warming and change to summer
                 precipitation, all simulations predict a decrease in maize
                 yields from late 20th century to middle and late 21st century
                 ranging from 15\% to 50\%. Linear regression of all models

                 out on the control of transcription start sites (TSSs). Of the
                 various wavelengths of light, it is blue light (BL) that
                 regulates physiological responses such as hypocotyl elongation
                 and flowering time. To understand how gene expression is
                 controlled not only by transcript abundance but also by TSS
                 selection, we examined genome-wide TSS profiles in Arabidopsis
                 seedlings after exposure to BL irradiation following initial
                 growth in the dark. Thousands of genes use multiple TSSs, and
                 some transcripts have upstream ORFs (uORFs) that take
                 precedence over the main ORF (mORF) encoding proteins. The
                 uORFs often function as translation inhibitors of the mORF or
                 as triggers of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).
                 Transcription from TSSs located downstream of the uORFs in 220
                 genes is enhanced by BL exposure. This type of regulation is
                 found in HY5 and HYH, major regulators of light-dependent gene
                 expression. Translation efficiencies of the genes showing
                 enhanced usage of these TSSs increased upon BL exposure. We
                 also show that transcripts from TSSs upstream of uORFs in 45
                 of the 220 genes, including HY5, accumulated in a mutant of
                 NMD. These results suggest that BL controls gene expression
                 not only by enhancing transcriptions but also by choosing the
                 TSS, and transcripts from downstream TSSs evade uORF-mediated
                 inhibition to ensure high expression of light-regulated genes.",

                 many discoveries were initially made in the controlled
                 conditions of greenhouses or laboratories, not in the field.
                 To test the comparability of drought responses across field
                 and greenhouse environments, we undertook three independent
                 experiments using the switchgrass reference genotype Alamo
                 AP13. We analyzed physiological and gene expression variation

                 Relatively similar physiological responses and expression

                 the mechanisms underlying plant responses to water deficit is
                 essential. Toward that end we have conducted an integrative
                 analysis of responses to drought stress in the perennial C4
                 grass and biofuel crop, Panicum virgatum (switchgrass).
                 Responses to soil drying and re-watering were measured at
                 transcriptional, physiological, and metabolomic levels. To
                 assess the interaction of soil moisture with diel light: dark
                 cycles, we profiled gene expression in drought and control
                 treatments under pre-dawn and mid-day conditions. RESULTS:
                 Soil drying resulted in reduced leaf water potential, gas
                 exchange, and chlorophyll fluorescence along with differential
                 expression of a large fraction of the transcriptome (37\%).
                 Many transcripts responded differently depending on time of
                 day (e.g. up-regulation pre-dawn and down-regulation mid-day).
                 Genes associated with C4 photosynthesis were down-regulated
                 during drought, while C4 metabolic intermediates accumulated.
                 Rapid changes in gene expression were observed during recovery
                 from drought, along with increased water use efficiency and
                 chlorophyll fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
                 demonstrate that drought responsive gene expression depends
                 strongly on time of day and that gene expression is
                 extensively modified during the first few hours of drought
                 recovery. Analysis of covariation in gene expression,
                 metabolite abundance, and physiology among plants revealed
                 non-linear relationships that suggest critical thresholds in
                 drought stress responses. Future studies may benefit from
                 evaluating these thresholds among diverse accessions of
                 switchgrass and other C4 grasses.",

                 types of maize except, possibly, some races from the highlands
                 of Guatemala. It is adapted to cool areas with mean growing
                 season temperatures between about 12.5 and 17.0 °C and is
                 superior to maize from temperate, mid-altitude tropical, and
                 lowland tropical regions for seedling emergence,
                 photosynthetically-based growth, and ability to continue grain
                 filling at low temperatures. It also has better frost and hail
                 tolerance, but is poorly adapted to high temperatures. It can
                 emerge from sowing as deep as 0.25 m, and is resistant to rust

                 Here, the adaptation process was studied in a tropical maize
                 population subjected to 10 recurrent generations of
                 directional selection for early flowering in a single
                 temperate environment in Iowa, USA. We evaluated the response

                 43.05° (WI) to 18.00° (PR) latitude. The capacity for an
                 all-tropical maize population to become adapted to a temperate
                 environment was revealed in a marked fashion: on average,
                 families from generation 10 flowered 20 days earlier than
                 families in generation 0, with a nine-day separation between
                 the latest generation 10 family and the earliest generation 0

                 selection on genetic main effects tailored to
                 temperature-dependent plasticity in flowering time.
                 Genotype-by-environment interactions represented a relatively
                 small component of the phenotypic variation in flowering time,

                 varieties across the world. Results: A new computational
                 pipeline was set up to process over 12 trillion bp of
                 sequencing data and a set of population genetics filters were
                 applied to identify over 83 million variant sites.
                 Conclusions: We identified polymorphisms in regions where
                 collinearity is largely preserved in the maize species.
                 However, the fact that the B73 genome used as the reference
                 only represents a fraction of all haplotypes is still an
                 important limiting factor.",

                 the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot

                 feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult
                 for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed,
                 many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with
                 which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity
                 of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these
                 machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK),
                 a structured programming framework designed to ease the
                 development of efficient and robust analysis tools for
                 next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional
                 programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small
                 but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the
                 majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis
                 calculations from common data management infrastructure
                 enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness,
                 stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable
                 distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight
                 the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation
                 and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage
                 calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling.

                 most directly related to overall grain yield. Additional seed
                 traits involved in seed shape may have also contributed to
                 larger grain. Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) kernel weight has

                 play an important role in the adaptation of plants to
                 environmental stress. In the central highlands of Mexico,
                 farmer selection has generated a unique group of maize
                 landraces adapted to the challenges of the highland niche. In
                 this study, gene expression in Mexican highland maize and a
                 reference maize breeding line were compared to identify
                 evidence of regulatory variation in stress-related genes. It
                 was hypothesised that local adaptation in Mexican highland
                 maize would be associated with a transcriptional signature
                 observable even under benign conditions. METHODS: Allele
                 specific expression analysis was performed using the
                 seedling-leaf transcriptome of an F1 individual generated from
                 the cross between the highland adapted Mexican landrace
                 Palomero Toluque{\~n}o and the reference line B73, grown under
                 benign conditions. Results were compared with a published
                 dataset describing the transcriptional response of B73
                 seedlings to cold, heat, salt and UV treatments. RESULTS: A
                 total of 2,386 genes were identified to show allele specific
                 expression. Of these, 277 showed an expression difference
                 between Palomero Toluque{\~n}o and B73 alleles under benign
                 conditions that anticipated the response of B73 cold, heat,
                 salt and/or UV treatments, and, as such, were considered to
                 display a prior stress response. Prior stress response
                 candidates included genes associated with plant hormone
                 signaling and a number of transcription factors. Construction
                 of a gene co-expression network revealed further signaling and
                 stress-related genes to be among the potential targets of the
                 transcription factors candidates. DISCUSSION: Prior activation
                 of responses may represent the best strategy when stresses are
                 severe but predictable. Expression differences observed here
                 between Palomero Toluque{\~n}o and B73 alleles indicate the
                 presence of cis-acting regulatory variation linked to
                 stress-related genes in Palomero Toluque{\~n}o. Considered
                 alongside gene annotation and population data, allele specific
                 expression analysis of plants grown under benign conditions
                 provides an attractive strategy to identify functional
                 variation potentially linked to local adaptation.",

                 in the USA is determined by a complex of factors including
                 soil type, crop system, local environmental conditions and
                 economic factors. These factors, and hence the patterns of
                 micronutrient deficiency and use, vary dramatically across the
                 US agricultural landscape. While soil mapping, crop analysis,
                 and more recent modeling procedures have been used to identify
                 broad regions and cropping systems in which the occurrence of
                 a deficiency can be expected, this information generally lacks
                 sufficient resolution to inform management decisions.
                 Micronutrient management in the USA is highly localized and
                 has historically been determined by the recommendations of
                 local university or government scientists and extension
                 agents.Data on the consumption of micronutrients in the USA
                 can be derived from records of commercial fertiliser sales and
                 from information derived from private industry. This data,
                 however, is scattered and incomplete and frequently of only
                 local relevance. Notwithstanding this paucity of statistically
                 rigorous data, it is clear that the patterns of use of
                 micronutrients in the USA are changing rapidly, and over the
                 last 5 years there has been a significant growth in
                 micronutrient application across US agriculture and important
                 changes in the manner in which fertilisers are used. Important
                 driving forces for this change include an increasing demand
                 for high quality and uniform product, changing agricultural
                 practices and increasing intensification including precision
                 agriculture, low-till management, and the use of genetically
                 modified crops. There is a growing recognition of the
                 environmental impact of agriculture, increasing interest in
                 sustainable production systems and adoption of stricter
                 environmental regulations. As the monetary, environmental and
                 societal cost of synthetic fungicides and pesticides
                 increases, there is also a growing interest in the concept of
                 optimised plant health through balanced plant nutrition which
                 will inevitably increase the use of micronutrients in US
                 agricultural production.The current growth in micronutrient
                 use in the USA coincides with a significant downsizing of
                 publicly funded, applied-research and extension and a greatly
                 diminished applied-research effort by fertiliser manufacturers
                 and distributors. Many of the recent changes in fertiliser
                 practice have occurred, therefore, without the research base
                 needed to implement those changes wisely and have resulted in
                 a growing gap between historic public-sector derived
                 recommendations and current practice. In the absence of
                 renewed investment in micronutrient research and adaptation,
                 the goal of increasing yields and crop quality while reducing
                 environmental impact will be very difficult to achieve.",

  abstract    = "It is tempting to invoke organismal selection as perpetually
                 optimizing the function of any given gene. However, natural
                 selection can drive genic functional change without
                 improvement of biochemical activity, even to the extinction of
                 gene activity. Detrimental mutations can creep in owing to
                 linkage with other selectively favored loci. Selection can
                 promote functional degradation, irrespective of genetic drift,
                 when adaptation occurs by loss of gene function. Even
                 stabilizing selection on a trait can lead to divergence of the

                 a new environment, however, the same bacteria may grow poorly
                 due to regulatory constraints or biochemical deficiencies.
                 Adaptation to such conditions can proceed through the
                 acquisition of new cellular functionality due to gain of
                 function mutations or via modulation of cellular networks.
                 Using selection experiments on transposon-mutagenized

                 conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial
                 adaptation can be achieved solely through loss of function
                 mutations, which rewire the metabolism of the cell without
                 gain of enzymatic or sensory function. A systematic analysis
                 of similar experiments under more than 100 conditions reveals
                 that adaptive loss of function mutations exist for many

                 published articles, we detail the range of mechanisms through
                 which loss-of-function mutations can generate such beneficial

                 mutations to fine-tune enzymatic activities or network

                 breeders avoided excessive branching because of low fertility.
                 We found branched variants carry mutations in two related

                 Understanding the dynamics of quantitative trait evolution is
                 crucial to future crop breeding. We characterized population
                 differentiation of maize landraces from the State of Oaxaca,
                 Mexico for quantitative traits and molecular markers. Qst
                 values were much higher than Fst values obtained for molecular
                 markers. While low values of Fst (0.011 within-village and
                 0.003 among-villages) suggest that considerable gene flow
                 occurred among the studied populations, high levels of
                 population differentiation for quantitative traits were
                 observed (ie an among-village Qst value of 0.535 for kernel
                 weight). Our results suggest that although quantitative traits
                 appear to be under strong divergent selection, a considerable

                 the evolution of flowering time in three experimental
                 populations of bread wheat, grown in contrasting environments
                 (Northern to Southern France) for 12 generations. By comparing
                 the distribution of phenotypic and presumably neutral
                 variation, we first showed that flowering time responded to
                 selection during the 12 generations of the experiment. To get
                 insight into the genetic architecture of that trait, we then

                 natural populations. One popular approach to infer whether the
                 observed degree of population differentiation has been
                 influenced by local adaptation is the comparison of neutral
                 marker gene differentiation (as reflected in FST) and
                 quantitative trait divergence (as reflected in QST). However,
                 this method may lead to compromised statistical power, because
                 FST and QST are summary statistics which neglect information
                 on specific pairs of populations, and because current
                 multivariate tests of neutrality involve an averaging
                 procedure over the traits. Further, most FST-QST comparisons
                 actually replace QST by its expectation over the evolutionary
                 process and are thus theoretically flawed. To overcome these

                 genetic architecture is composed of a complex network of
                 interacting genes rather than single genes that act
                 independently to determine the trait. As such, selection acts
                 on entire gene networks. Here, we begin to define the genetic
                 regulatory network to which the maize domestication gene,
                 teosinte branched1 (tb1), belongs. Using a combination of
                 molecular methods to uncover either direct or indirect

                 downstream of tb1 in a gene network regulating both plant and

                 of intense debate, is that of the mechanisms of biological
                 evolution. In this context, Waddington elaborated the concepts
                 of ``canalization and assimilation'' to explain how an
                 apparently somatic variant induced by stress could become
                 heritable through the germline in Drosophila He resolved this
                 seemingly Lamarckian phenomenon by positing the existence of
                 cryptic mutations that can be expressed and selected under
                 stress. To investigate the relevance of such mechanisms, we
                 performed experiments following the Waddington procedure, then
                 isolated and fixed three phenotypic variants along with
                 another induced mutation that was not preceded by any
                 phenocopy. All the fixed mutations we looked at were actually
                 generated de novo by DNA deletions or transposon insertions,
                 highlighting a novel mechanism for the assimilation process.
                 Our study shows that heat-shock stress produces both
                 phenotypic variants and germline mutations, and suggests an
                 alternative explanation to that of Waddington for the apparent
                 assimilation of an acquired character. The selection of the
                 variants, under stress, for a number of generations allows for
                 the coselection of newly induced corresponding germline
                 mutations, making the phenotypic variants appear heritable.",

                 termed the crown. Although this postembryonic shoot-borne root
                 system represents the major conduit for water uptake, little
                 is known about the effect of water availability on its

                 Luminescence-based imaging of root systems grown in soil-like

                 nitrate. However, nitrate is often distributed heterogeneously
                 in natural soil. Plants, therefore, have a systemic
                 long-distance signalling mechanism by which N starvation on
                 one side of the root leads to a compensatory N uptake on the
                 other N-rich side(1,2). This systemic N acquisition response
                 is triggered by a root-to-shoot mobile peptide hormone,
                 C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP), originating from the
                 N-starved roots(3,4), but the molecular nature of the
                 descending shoot-to-root signal remains elusive. Here, we show
                 that phloem-specific polypeptides that are induced in leaves
                 upon perception of root-derived CEP act as descending

                 also are important for responses to stress and the
                 biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the
                 pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to
                 alternative energy, desiccation, and seed vigor; thus,
                 manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed's
                 nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies
                 (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some
                 regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation
                 of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains
                 mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a
                 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) association
                 panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived
                 from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then
                 on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based
                 metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were
                 compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of

                 polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former
                 approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was
                 for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two
                 genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a
                 polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with
                 fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be
                 responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits
                 across the association panel. Given that His is a
                 semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4

                 families. Consequently, pleiotropic effects and gene
                 redundancy are responsible for phenotype resistance. Here,
                 techniques are presented to detect unexpected pleiotropic
                 changes in such instances despite very subtle changes in

              difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying an
              inversion's role in adaptation. In this study, we used
              large-scale transcriptomic data to dissect the functional
              importance of a 13 Mb inversion locus (Inv4m) found almost
              exclusively in highland populations of maize (Zea mays ssp.
              mays). Inv4m was introgressed into highland maize from the wild
              relative Zea mays ssp. mexicana, also present in the highlands of
              Mexico, and is thought to be important for the adaptation of
              these populations to cultivation in highland environments.
              However, the specific genetic variants and traits that underlie
              this adaptation are not known. We created two families

              We found diverse physiological effects of Inv4m across the 9

  author      = "Bellon, Mauricio R and Hodson, David and Hellin, Jon",
  abstract    = "Climate change is predicted to have major impacts on
                 small-scale farmers in Mexico whose livelihoods depend on
                 rain-fed maize. We examined the capacity of traditional maize
                 seed systems to provide these farmers with appropriate genetic
                 material under predicted agro-ecological conditions associated
                 with climate change. We studied the structure and spatial
                 scope of seed systems of 20 communities in four transects
                 across an altitudinal gradient from 10-2,980 m above sea level
                 in five states of eastern Mexico. Results indicate that 90\%
                 of all of the seed lots are obtained within 10 km of a
                 community and 87\% within an altitudinal range of $\pm$50 m
                 but with variation across four agro-climate environments: wet
                 lowland, dry lowland, wet upper midlatitude, and highlands.
                 Climate models suggest a drying and warming trend for the
                 entire study area during the main maize season, leading to
                 substantial shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of
                 agro-climate environments. For all communities except those in
                 the highlands, predicted future maize environments already are
                 represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in
                 the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting
                 material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and
                 probably will need to acquire seed from outside their
                 traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources
                 probably will entail important information costs and the
                 development of new seed and associated social networks,
                 including improved linkages between traditional and formal
                 seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply
                 chains. The study has implications for analogous areas

                 to characterize the genetic diversity of over 3000 maize
                 landraces from across the Americas. First, we mapped the

                 adaptation, identifying 1498 genes. Second, we developed and
                 used F-One Association Mapping (FOAM) to directly map genes
                 controlling flowering time across 22 environments, identifying
                 1,005 genes. In total 65\% of the SNPs associated with

  title       = "Growing degree-days: one equation, two interpretations",
  author      = "McMaster, Gregory S and Wilhelm, W W",
  abstract    = "Heat units, expressed in growing degree-days (GDD), are
                 frequently used to describe the timing of biological
                 processes. The basic equation used is GDD = [(TMAX +
                 TMIN)2]−TBASE, where TMAX and TMIN are daily maximum and
                 minimum air temperature, respectively, and TBASE is the base
                 temperature. Two methods of interpreting this equation for
                 calculating GDD are: (1) if the daily mean temperature is less
                 than the base, it is set equal to the base temperature, or (2)
                 if TMAX or TMIN < TBASE they are reset equal to TBASE. The
                 objective of this paper is to show the differences which can
                 result from using these two methods to estimate GDD, and make
                 researchers and practitioners aware of the need to report
                 clearly which method was used in the calculations. Although
                 percent difference between methods of calculation are
                 dependent on TMAX and TMIN data used to compute GDD, our
                 comparisons have produced differences up to 83\% when using a
                 0°C base for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Greater differences
                 were found for corn (Zea mays L.) when using a base
                 temperature of 10°C. Differences between the methods occur if
                 only TMIN is less than TBASE, and then Method 1 accumulates
                 fewer GDD than Method 2. When incorporating an upper
                 threshold, as commonly done with corn, there was a greater
                 difference between the two methods. Not recognizing the
                 discrepancy between methods can result in confusion and add
                 error in quantifying relationships between heat unit
                 accumulation and timing of events in crop development and
                 growth, particularly in crop simulation models. This paper
                 demonstrates the need for authors to clearly communicate the
                 method of calculating GDD so others can correctly interpret
                 and apply reported results.",

                 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high
                 diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure
                 for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome
                 complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is
                 simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and
                 may reach important regions of the genome that are
                 inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using
                 methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can
                 be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three
                 fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies
                 computationally challenging alignment problems in species with
                 high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is
                 demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley)
                 recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and
                 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage
                 in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is
                 that a reference map need only be developed around the
                 restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of
                 sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read
                 clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the
                 reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence
                 of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated
                 as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding,
                 conservation, and global species and population surveys may
                 allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel
                 germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior
                 molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine
                 population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or

                 user-friendly interface for running angsd and visualizing

                 status was investigated at the molecular level in Arabidopsis
                 thaliana plants through expression analysis of AtNrt2.1 and
                 AtAmt1.1. These two genes encode starvation-induced
                 high-affinity NO3- and NH4+ transporters, respectively.
                 Split-root experiments indicate that AtNrt2.1 expression is
                 controlled by shoot-to-root signals of N demand. Together with
                 15NO3- influx, the steady-state transcript level of this gene
                 is increased in NO3--fed roots in response to N deprivation of
                 another portion of the root system. Thus AtNrt2.1 is the first
                 identified molecular target of the long-distance signalling
                 informing the roots of the whole plant's N status. In
                 contrast, AtAmt1.1 expression is predominantly dependent on
                 the local N status of the roots, as it is mostly stimulated in
                 the portion of the root system directly experiencing N
                 starvation. The same behaviour was found for NH4+ influx,
                 suggesting that the NH4+ uptake system is much less efficient
                 than the NO3- uptake system, to compensate for a spatial
                 restriction of N availability. Other major differences were
                 found between the regulations of AtNrt2.1 and AtAmt1.1
                 expression. AtNrt2.1 is strongly upregulated by moderate level
                 of N limitation, while AtAmt1.1 transcript level is markedly
                 increased only under severe N deficiency. Unlike AtNrt2.1,
                 AtAmt1.1 expression is not stimulated in a nitrate
                 reductase-deficient mutant after transfer to NO3- as sole N
                 source, indicating that NO3- per se acts as a signal
                 repressing transcription of AtAmt1.1. These results reveal two
                 fundamentally different types of mechanism involved in the
                 feedback regulation of root N acquisition by the N status of
                 the plant.",

                 the PHO1 gene family. The cDNAs of all PHO1 homologs have been
                 cloned and sequenced. All proteins have the same topology and
                 harbor a SPX tripartite domain in the N-terminal hydrophilic
                 portion and an EXS domain in the C-terminal hydrophobic
                 portion. The SPX and EXS domains have been identified in yeast
                 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) proteins involved in either
                 phosphate transport or sensing or in sorting proteins to
                 endomembranes. The Arabidopsis genome contains additional
                 proteins of unknown function containing either a SPX or an EXS

  abstract    = "The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and
                 phosphorus (P) are interlinked by primary production,
                 respiration and decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. It
                 has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become
                 uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different
                 degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by
                 biological and geochemical processes. Climatic controls on
                 biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid,
                 semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because
                 their biological activity is mainly driven by water
                 availability. The increase in aridity predicted for the
                 twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide may therefore
                 threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially
                 affecting the availability of essential nutrients. Here we
                 evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in
                 soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents
                 except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the
                 concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive
                 effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is
                 negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the
                 dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a
                 major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes
                 that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition. Our
                 findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with
                 climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N
                 and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These
                 changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and
                 could negatively affect the provision of key services provided
                 by these ecosystems.",

                 microenvironment in the soil and deploy strategic root growth

                 Remarkably, this new paradigm for systems biology research has
                 intrigued plant biologists for more than a century, when a
                 split-root framework was first used to study how plants sense
                 and respond to heterogeneous soil nutrient environments. This
                 systemic N-signalling mechanism, allowing plants to sense and
                 forage for mineral nutrients in resource-rich patches, has
                 important implications for agriculture. In this review, we
                 will focus on how advances in the post-genomic era have
                 uncovered the gene regulatory networks underlying systemic
                 N-signalling. After defining how local and systemic
                 N-signalling can be experimentally distinguished for molecular
                 study using a split-root system, the genetic factors that have
                 been shown to mediate local and/or systemic N-signalling are
                 reviewed. Second, the genetic mechanism of this regulatory
                 system is broadened to the whole genome level. To do this,
                 publicly available N-related transcriptomic datasets are
                 compared with genes that have previously been identified as
                 local and systemic N responders in a split-root transcriptome
                 dataset. Specifically, (i) it was found that transcriptional
                 reprogramming triggered by homogeneous N-treatments is
                 composed of both local and systemic responses, (ii) the
                 spatio-temporal signature of local versus systemic responsive
                 genes is defined, and (iii) the conservation of systemic
                 N-signalling between Arabidopsis and Medicago is assessed.
                 Finally, the potential mediators, i.e. metabolites and

                 phenocopying the Pi signaling mutant pho2. PHO2 encodes a
                 putative E2 conjugase, UBC24. Here, we show that NLA is an E3
                 ligase that specifically requires UBC24 for polyubiquitination
                 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Among five members of the Pht1
                 Pi-transporter family tested, NLA associates only with PT2
                 (Pht1;4). The NLA-UBC24 pair mediates polyubiquitination of
                 PT2 but not PT1. Posttranslational decay of PT2 at high Pi is
                 blocked in pho2 and inhibited by MG132, indicating the
                 requirement of UBC24 and 26S proteasomes. Consistent with
                 NLA/UBC24 function, induced NLA expression causes a
                 UBC24-dependent decrease in PT2 levels. Confocal microscopy of
                 fusion proteins revealed an NLA/PT2 interaction at the plasma

                 Pi-replete conditions, NLA and UBC24 target the PT2

                 response, NLA and PHO2 transcripts are cleaved by miR399 and
                 miR827, respectively, and our results suggest that this
                 downregulation relieves the posttranslational repression of
                 PT2, allowing it to accumulate and participate in Pi uptake.
                 Our work provides additional molecular details describing Pi
                 signaling/homeostasis regulation by identifying NLA and UBC24

                 important role in the control of phosphate (Pi) starvation
                 stress responses. Using transcriptomic analysis of Pi
                 starvation in phr1, and phr1 phr1-like (phl1) mutants and in
                 wild type plants, we show that PHR1 in conjunction with PHL1
                 controls most transcriptional activation and repression
                 responses to phosphate starvation, regardless of the Pi
                 starvation specificity of these responses. Induced genes are
                 enriched in PHR1 binding sequences (P1BS) in their promoters,
                 whereas repressed genes do not show such enrichment,
                 suggesting that PHR1(-like) control of transcriptional
                 repression responses is indirect. In agreement with this,
                 transcriptomic analysis of a transgenic plant expressing PHR1
                 fused to the hormone ligand domain of the glucocorticoid
                 receptor showed that PHR1 direct targets (i.e., displaying
                 altered expression after GR:PHR1 activation by dexamethasone
                 in the presence of cycloheximide) corresponded largely to Pi
                 starvation-induced genes that are highly enriched in P1BS. A
                 minimal promoter containing a multimerised P1BS recapitulates
                 Pi starvation-specific responsiveness. Likewise, mutation of
                 P1BS in the promoter of two Pi starvation-responsive genes
                 impaired their responsiveness to Pi starvation, but not to
                 other stress types. Phylogenetic footprinting confirmed the
                 importance of P1BS and PHR1 in Pi starvation responsiveness
                 and indicated that P1BS acts in concert with other cis motifs.
                 All together, our data show that PHR1 and PHL1 are partially
                 redundant TF acting as central integrators of Pi starvation
                 responses, both specific and generic. In addition, they

                 long-distance communication between roots and shoots, but the
                 participating components are poorly understood. We have
                 studied the topology of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
                 PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) Pi exporter and defined the functions of its
                 different domains in Pi homeostasis and signaling. The results
                 indicate that the amino and carboxyl termini of PHO1 are both
                 oriented toward the cytosol and that the protein spans the
                 membrane twice in the EXS domain, resulting in a total of six
                 transmembrane $\alpha$-helices. Using transient expression in
                 Nicotiana benthamiana leaf, we demonstrated that the EXS
                 domain of PHO1 is essential for Pi export activity and proper
                 localization to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network, although
                 the EXS domain by itself cannot mediate Pi export. In
                 contrast, removal of the amino-terminal hydrophilic SPX domain
                 does not affect the Pi export capacity of the truncated PHO1
                 in N. benthamiana. While the Arabidopsis pho1 mutant has low
                 shoot Pi and shows all the hallmarks associated with Pi
                 deficiency, including poor shoot growth and overexpression of
                 numerous Pi deficiency-responsive genes, expression of only
                 the EXS domain of PHO1 in the roots of the pho1 mutant results
                 in a remarkable improvement of shoot growth despite low shoot
                 Pi. Transcriptomic analysis of pho1 expressing the EXS domain
                 indicates an attenuation of the Pi signaling cascade and the
                 up-regulation of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and the
                 synthesis or response to several phytohormones in leaves as

                 double-strand breaks (DSBs) in plant genomes. Thus, homologous
                 recombination (HR) can be enhanced and targeted mutagenesis
                 can be achieved by error-prone non-homologous end-joining
                 (NHEJ). Recently, the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system was used
                 for DSB induction in plants to promote HR and NHEJ. Cas9 can
                 also be engineered to work as a nickase inducing single-strand
                 breaks (SSBs). Here we show that only the nuclease but not the
                 nickase is an efficient tool for NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis in
                 plants. We demonstrate the stable inheritance of
                 nuclease-induced targeted mutagenesis events in the ADH1 and
                 TT4 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana at frequencies from 2.5 up
                 to 70.0\%. Deep sequencing analysis revealed NHEJ-mediated DSB
                 repair in about a third of all reads in T1 plants. In
                 contrast, applying the nickase resulted in the reduction of
                 mutation frequency by at least 740-fold. Nevertheless, the
                 nickase is able to induce HR at similar efficiencies as the
                 nuclease or the homing endonuclease I-SceI. Two different
                 types of somatic HR mechanisms, recombination between tandemly
                 arranged direct repeats as well as gene conversion using the
                 information on an inverted repeat could be enhanced by the
                 nickase to a similar extent as by DSB-inducing enzymes. Thus,
                 the Cas9 nickase has the potential to become an important tool
                 for genome engineering in plants. It should not only be
                 applicable for HR-mediated gene targeting systems but also by

                 function and yield. They are also under-explored targets to
                 meet global food and energy demands. Many new technologies
                 have been developed to characterize crop root system
                 architecture (CRSA). These technologies have the potential to
                 accelerate the progress in understanding the genetic control
                 and environmental response of CRSA. Putting this potential
                 into practice requires new methods and algorithms to analyze
                 CRSA in digital images. Most prior approaches have solely
                 focused on the estimation of root traits from images, yet no
                 integrated platform exists that allows easy and intuitive
                 access to trait extraction and analysis methods from images
                 combined with storage solutions linked to metadata. Automated
                 high-throughput phenotyping methods are increasingly used in
                 laboratory-based efforts to link plant genotype with
                 phenotype, whereas similar field-based studies remain
                 predominantly manual low-throughput. DESCRIPTION: Here, we
                 present an open-source phenomics platform ``DIRT'', as a means
                 to integrate scalable supercomputing architectures into field
                 experiments and analysis pipelines. DIRT is an online platform
                 that enables researchers to store images of plant roots,
                 measure dicot and monocot root traits under field conditions,
                 and share data and results within collaborative teams and the
                 broader community. The DIRT platform seamlessly connects
                 end-users with large-scale compute ``commons'' enabling the
                 estimation and analysis of root phenotypes from field
                 experiments of unprecedented size. CONCLUSION: DIRT is an
                 automated high-throughput computing and collaboration platform
                 for field based crop root phenomics. The platform is
                 accessible at http://www.dirt.iplantcollaborative.org/ and
                 hosted on the iPlant cyber-infrastructure using
                 high-throughput grid computing resources of the Texas Advanced
                 Computing Center (TACC). DIRT is a high volume central
                 depository and high-throughput RSA trait computation platform
                 for plant scientists working on crop roots. It enables
                 scientists to store, manage and share crop root images with
                 metadata and compute RSA traits from thousands of images in
                 parallel. It makes high-throughput RSA trait computation
                 available to the community with just a few button clicks. As
                 such it enables plant scientists to spend more time on science
                 rather than on technology. All stored and computed data is
                 easily accessible to the public and broader scientific
                 community. We hope that easy data accessibility will attract
                 new tool developers and spur creative data usage that may even
                 be applied to other fields of science.",

              relies on successful associations of heritable molecular
              variation with observable phenotypes. Historically, this pursuit
              has primarily been based on easily measurable genetic markers.
              The recent advent of new technologies allows assaying and
              quantifying biological intermediates (hereafter endophenotypes)
              which are now readily measurable at a large scale across diverse
              individuals. The usefulness of endophenotypes for delineating the
              regulatory landscape of the genome and genetic dissection of
              complex trait variation remains underexplored in plants. The work
              presented here illustrated the utility of a large-scale
              (299-genotype and seven-tissue) gene expression resource to
              dissect traits across multiple levels of biological organization.
              Using single-tissue- and multi-tissue-based transcriptome-wide
              association studies (TWAS), we revealed that about half of the
              functional variation acts through altered transcript abundance
              for maize kernel traits, including 30 grain carotenoid abundance
              traits, 20 grain tocochromanol abundance traits, and 22
              field-measured agronomic traits. Comparing the efficacy of TWAS
              with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and an ensemble
              approach that combines both GWAS and TWAS, we demonstrated that
              results of TWAS in combination with GWAS increase the power to
              detect known genes and aid in prioritizing likely causal genes.
              Using a variance partitioning approach in the largely independent
              maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population, we also showed
              that the most strongly associated genes identified by combining
              GWAS and TWAS explain more heritable variance for a majority of
              traits than the heritability captured by the random genes and the
              genes identified by GWAS or TWAS alone. This not only improves
              the ability to link genes to phenotypes, but also highlights the
              phenotypic consequences of regulatory variation in plants.",

               Mexico in the 1940s, two agencies ran separate programs for corn
               improvement. The Rockefeller Foundation's Office of Special
               Studies and the Mexican government's Office of Experiment
               Stations (later called the Agricultural Research Institute)
               carried out research on corn with distinct aims and methods.
               That they differed strongly is well established in the
               literature. Many authors have discussed a Rockefeller Foundation
               program that reportedly emphasized hybrid corn, a technical
               choice that embodied a preference for assisting wealthy farmers
               who could afford hybrid corn and the necessary agricultural
               inputs. Conversely, these authors attribute to the Mexican
               program a focus on open-pollinated corn, which presumably
               manifested its concern for Mexico's small farmers who saved
               seed. This article argues that the reverse was true. The
               Rockefeller Foundation program initially was committed to a type
               of improved open-pollinated corn while the Mexican program
               proceeded with a strict, U.S.-style hybrid program. I try to
               illuminate each group's priority on yield, as well as additional

               genes were subclassified as able to express both mRNAs and

               associated only with the former subclass. More than 60,000

              develop new breeds for future climate scenarios in agriculture.
              Using a unique study design, we simultaneously dissected the
              population and quantitative genomic basis of short-term evolution
              in a tropical landrace of maize that was translocated to a
              temperate environment and phenotypically selected for adaptation
              in flowering time phenology. Underlying ten generations of
              directional selection, which resulted in a 26-day mean decrease
              in female-flowering time, 60\% of the heritable variation mapped
              to 14\% of the genome, where, overall, alleles shifted in
              frequency beyond the boundaries of genetic drift in the expected
              direction given their flowering time effects. However, clustering
              these non-neutral alleles based on their profiles of frequency
              change revealed transient shifts underpinning a transition in
              genotype-phenotype relationships across generations. This was
              distinguished by initial reductions in the frequencies of few
              relatively large positive effect alleles and subsequent
              enrichment of many rare negative effect alleles, some of which
              appear to represent allelic series. With this architecture, the
              population reached an adapted state while retaining 99\% of the
              standing molecular marker variation in the founding population.
              Robust selection and association mapping tests highlighted
              several key genes driving the phenotypic response to selection.

              to understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic
              variation in a single sample taken from a present-day population.
              However, genomic data collected over tens of generations in both
              natural and laboratory populations are increasingly used to find
              selected loci underpinning adaptation over these short
              timescales. Although these studies have been quite successful in
              detecting selection on large-effect loci, the fitness differences
              between individuals are often polygenic, such that selection
              leads to allele frequency changes that are difficult to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from polygenic selection's effect on neutral sites that
              become stochastically associated with the genetic backgrounds
              that lead to fitness differences between individuals. Previous
              theoretical work has established that the random associations
              between a neutral allele and heritable fitness backgrounds act to
              reduce the effective population size experienced by this neutral
              allele. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency
              trajectories, creating autocovariance in the allele frequency
              changes across generations. Here, we show how temporal genomic
              data allow us to measure the temporal autocovariance in allele
              frequency changes and characterize the genome-wide impact of
              polygenic selection. We develop expressions for these temporal
              autocovariances, showing that their magnitude is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate that one can estimate the
              additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective
              population size from temporal genomic data. We also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Overall, we
              demonstrate that temporal genomic data offer opportunities to
              identify the role of linked selection on genome-wide diversity
              over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and

              depression by uncovering recessive deleterious variants, unless
              these variants are purged by selection. Here we investigated the
              dynamics of purging in a set of eleven maize lines that were
              selfed for six generations. We show that heterozygous, putatively
              deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms are preferentially
              lost from the genome during selfing. Deleterious single
              nucleotide polymorphisms were lost more rapidly in regions of
              high recombination, presumably because recombination increases
              the efficacy of selection by uncoupling linked variants. Overall,
              heterozygosity decreased more slowly than expected, by an
              estimated 35\% to 40\% per generation instead of the expected
              50\%, perhaps reflecting pervasive associative overdominance.
              Finally, three lines exhibited marked decreases in genome size
              due to the purging of transposable elements. Genome loss was more
              likely to occur for lineages that began with larger genomes with
              more transposable elements and chromosomal knobs. These three

              cells of the haploid gametophyte. Doubled haploid production
              fixes recombinant haploid genomes in inbred lines, shaving years
              off the breeding process. Costly, genotype-dependent tissue
              culture methods are used in many crops, while seed-based in vivo
              doubled haploid systems are rare in nature and difficult to
              manage in breeding programmes. The multi-billion-dollar maize
              hybrid seed business, however, is supported by industrial doubled
              haploid pipelines using intraspecific crosses to in vivo haploid
              inducer males derived from Stock 6, first reported in 1959 (ref.

              mode of action remains controversial. Here we establish, through
              fine mapping, genome sequencing, genetic complementation, and
              gene editing, that haploid induction in maize (Zea mays) is
              triggered by a frame-shift mutation in MATRILINEAL (MTL), a
              pollen-specific phospholipase, and that novel edits in MTL lead
              to a 6.7\% haploid induction rate (the percentage of haploid
              progeny versus total progeny). Wild-type MTL protein localizes
              exclusively to sperm cytoplasm, and pollen RNA-sequence profiling
              identifies a suite of pollen-specific genes overexpressed during
              haploid induction, some of which may mediate the formation of
              haploid seed. These findings highlight the importance of male
              gamete cytoplasmic components to reproductive success and male
              genome transmittance. Given the conservation of MTL in the
              cereals, this discovery may enable development of in vivo haploid

              that were genotyped with 56,110 single nucleotide polymorphism

  abstract = "Understanding genome to phenotype linkages has been greatly
              enabled by genomic sequencing. However, most genome analysis is
              typically confined to the nuclear genome. We conducted a
              metabolomic QTL analysis on a reciprocal RIL population
              structured to examine how variation in the organelle genomes
              affects phenotypic variation. This showed that the cytoplasmic
              variation had effects similar to, if not larger than, the largest
              individual nuclear locus. Inclusion of cytoplasmic variation into
              the genetic model greatly increased the explained phenotypic
              variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation was a central hub in the
              epistatic network controlling the plant metabolome. This
              epistatic influence manifested such that the cytoplasmic
              background could alter or hide pairwise epistasis between nuclear
              loci. Thus, cytoplasmic genetic variation plays a central role in
              controlling natural variation in metabolomic networks. This
              suggests that cytoplasmic genomes must be included in any future

              Mexico ∼9,000 years ago from its wild ancestor, teosinte (Zea
              mays ssp. parviglumis) [1]. From its center of origin, maize
              experienced a rapid range expansion and spread over 90° of
              latitude in the Americas [2-4], which required a novel
              flowering-time adaptation. ZEA CENTRORADIALIS 8 (ZCN8) is the
              maize florigen gene and has a central role in mediating flowering
              [5, 6]. Here, we show that ZCN8 underlies a major quantitative
              trait locus (QTL) (qDTA8) for flowering time that was
              consistently detected in multiple maize-teosinte experimental
              populations. Through association analysis in a large diverse
              panel of maize inbred lines, we identified a SNP (SNP-1245) in
              the ZCN8 promoter that showed the strongest association with
              flowering time. SNP-1245 co-segregated with qDTA8 in
              maize-teosinte mapping populations. We demonstrate that SNP-1245
              is associated with differential binding by the flowering
              activator ZmMADS1. SNP-1245 was a target of selection during
              early domestication, which drove the pre-existing early flowering
              allele to near fixation in maize. Interestingly, we detected an
              independent association block upstream of SNP-1245, wherein the
              early flowering allele that most likely originated from Zea mays
              ssp. mexicana introgressed into the early flowering haplotype of
              SNP-1245 and contributed to maize adaptation to northern high

              variants at a gene can be selected at different evolutionary
              times for local adaptation, highlighting how complex

              for evidence of selection on genome size and individual repeat
              abundance. We find that population structure alone cannot explain

              lines in seven tissues. We mapped expression quantitative trait
              loci and characterized the contribution of rare genetic variants
              to extremes in gene expression. Some of the new mutations that
              arise in the maize genome can be deleterious; although selection
              acts to keep deleterious variants rare, their complete removal is
              impeded by genetic linkage to favourable loci and by finite
              population size. Modern maize breeders have systematically
              reduced the effects of this constant mutational pressure through
              artificial selection and self-fertilization, which have exposed
              rare recessive variants in elite inbred lines. However, the

              Limitation of grain crop productivity by phosphorus (P) is
              widespread and will probably increase in the future. Enhanced P
              efficiency can be achieved by improved uptake of phosphate from
              soil (P-acquisition efficiency) and by improved productivity per
              unit P taken up (P-use efficiency). This review focuses on
              improved P-use efficiency, which can be achieved by plants that
              have overall lower P concentrations, and by optimal distribution
              and redistribution of P in the plant allowing maximum growth and
              biomass allocation to harvestable plant parts. Significant
              decreases in plant P pools may be possible, for example, through
              reductions of superfluous ribosomal RNA and replacement of
              phospholipids by sulfolipids and galactolipids. Improvements in P
              distribution within the plant may be possible by increased
              remobilization from tissues that no longer need it (e.g.
              senescing leaves) and reduced partitioning of P to developing
              grains. Such changes would prolong and enhance the productive use
              of P in photosynthesis and have nutritional and environmental
              benefits. Research considering physiological, metabolic,
              molecular biological, genetic and phylogenetic aspects of P-use
              efficiency is urgently needed to allow significant progress to be
              made in our understanding of this complex trait.",

              disequilibrium (LD), the method first infers ancestral haplotypes
              and their loadings at each marker for each individual. The
              loadings are then used to quantify local haplotype sharing
              between individuals at each marker. A statistical model was
              developed to link the local haplotype sharing and phenotypes to
              test for association. We devised a novel method to fit the LD
              model, reducing the complexity from putatively quadratic to
              linear (in the number of ancestral haplotypes). Therefore, the LD
              model can be fitted to all study samples simultaneously, and,
              consequently, our method is applicable to big data sets. Compared
              to existing haplotype association methods, our method integrated
              out phase uncertainty, avoided arbitrariness in specifying

              address the hypothesis that naturally occurring allelic variation
              conditions MDR, we extended the framework of structured
              association mapping to allow for the analysis of correlated
              complex traits and the identification of pleiotropic genes. The
              multivariate analytical approach used here is directly applicable
              to any species and set of traits exhibiting correlation. From our
              analysis of a diverse panel of maize inbred lines, we discovered
              high positive genetic correlations between resistances to three
              globally threatening fungal diseases. The maize panel studied
              exhibits rapidly decaying linkage disequilibrium that generally
              occurs within 1 or 2 kb, which is less than the average length of
              a maize gene. The positive correlations therefore suggested that
              functional allelic variation at specific genes for MDR exists in
              maize. Using a multivariate test statistic, a glutathione
              S-transferase (GST) gene was found to be associated with modest
              levels of resistance to all three diseases. Resequencing analysis
              pinpointed the association to a histidine (basic amino acid) for
              aspartic acid (acidic amino acid) substitution in the encoded
              protein domain that defines GST substrate specificity and
              biochemical activity. The known functions of GSTs suggested that

              breeding with exotic germplasm, especially tropical-exotic

              large and diverse, making choices of tropical parents difficult.
              The maize breeding program at North Carolina State University has
              initiated a large-scale screening effort to evaluate elite exotic
              maize inbreds, most of which are tropical-exotic in origin. Here
              we report screening results for 88 inbreds obtained from various

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful
              tool for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and causal
              single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/genes associated with
              various important traits in crop species. Typically, GWAS in
              crops are performed using a panel of inbred lines, where multiple
              replicates of the same inbred are measured and the average
              phenotype is taken as the response variable. Here we describe and
              evaluate single plant GWAS (sp-GWAS) for performing a GWAS on
              individual plants, which does not require an association panel of
              inbreds. Instead sp-GWAS relies on the phenotypes and genotypes
              from individual plants sampled from a randomly mating population.
              Importantly, we demonstrate how sp-GWAS can be efficiently
              combined with a bulk segregant analysis (BSA) experiment to
              rapidly corroborate evidence for significant SNPs. RESULTS: In
              this study we used the Shoepeg maize landrace, collected as an
              open pollinating variety from a farm in Southern Missouri in the
              1960's, to evaluate whether sp-GWAS coupled with BSA can
              efficiently and powerfully used to detect significant association
              of SNPs for plant height (PH). Plant were grown in 8 locations
              across two years and in total 768 individuals were genotyped and
              phenotyped for sp-GWAS. A total of 306 k polymorphic markers in
              768 individuals evaluated via association analysis detected 25
              significant SNPs (P $\leq$ 0.00001) for PH. The results from our
              single-plant GWAS were further validated by bulk segregant
              analysis (BSA) for PH. BSA sequencing was performed on the same
              population by selecting tall and short plants as separate bulks.
              This approach identified 37 genomic regions for plant height. Of
              the 25 significant SNPs from GWAS, the three most significant
              SNPs co-localize with regions identified by BSA. CONCLUSION:
              Overall, this study demonstrates that sp-GWAS coupled with BSA
              can be a useful tool for detecting significant SNPs and
              identifying candidate genes. This result is particularly useful
              for species/populations where association panels are not readily
              available.",

              opportunities in crops due to their complex pedigree structure.
              They offer great potential both for dissecting genomic structure
              and for improving breeding populations. The past decade has seen
              the rise of multiparental populations as a study design offering
              great advantages for genetic studies in plants. The genetic
              diversity of multiple parents, recombined over several
              generations, generates a genetic resource population with large
              phenotypic diversity suitable for high-resolution trait mapping.
              While there are many variations on the general design, this
              review focuses on populations where the parents have all been
              inter-mated, typically termed Multi-parent Advanced Generation
              Intercrosses (MAGIC). Such populations have already been created
              in model animals and plants, and are emerging in many crop
              species. However, there has been little consideration of the full
              range of factors which create novel challenges for design and
              analysis in these populations. We will present brief descriptions
              of large MAGIC crop studies currently in progress to motivate

              these resources post-QTL analysis for gene discovery.",

              population sizes without the need to carry out large-scale
              phenotyping and hence is a cost-effective means of capturing
              information about gene-trait relationships within a population.
              The diversity within the sample gives an indication of the
              efficiency of this information capture; less diversity implies
              greater redundancy of the genetic information. Here, we propose a
              method to maximize genetic diversity within the selected samples.
              Our method is applicable to general experimental designs and
              robust to common problems such as missing data and dominant
              markers. In particular, we discuss its application to
              multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations,
              where, although thousands of lines may be genotyped as a large
              population resource, only hundreds may need to be phenotyped for
              individual studies. Through simulation, we compare our method to
              simple random sampling and the minimum moment aberration method.
              While the gain in power over simple random sampling for all
              tested methods is not large, our method results in a much more
              diverse sample of genotypes. This diversity can be applied to
              improve fine mapping resolution once a QTL region has been
              detected. Further, when applied to two wheat datasets from
              doubled haploid and MAGIC progeny, our method detects known QTL

              environment analysis on phenotypic values 9averaged9 across
              environments. This method can be useful to detect QTLs with a
              consistent effect across environments but it does not allow to
              estimate environment-specific QTL (QTLxE) effects. Running
              separate single environment analyses is a possibility to measure
              QTLxE effects but those analyses do not model the genetic
              covariance due to the use of the same genotype in different
              environments. In this paper, we propose methods to analyze MPP-ME
              QTL experiments using simultaneously the data from several
              environments and modelling the genotypic covariances. Using data
              from the EU-NAM and the US-NAM populations, we show that these

  abstract = "Interpopulation recurrent selection methods can be used for
              developing new heterotic patterns and enhancing those identified
              previously. The objective of this research was to estimate the
              direct and indirect responses to eight cycles of reciprocal
              full-sib recurrent selection in maize (Zea mays L.) populations
              BS10 and BS11. The populations and their crosses corresponding to
              Cycles 0, 2, 4,6, and 8 were evaluated at two levels of
              inbreeding (F = 0 and F = 0.5), and populations also were
              testcrossed to the respective Cycle 0 populations and unrelated
              inbred lines. Entries were evaluated in eight environments. Eight
              cycles of selection were effective for increasing grain yield of
              the population cross (6.5\% cycle?1), BS10 (3.0\% cycle?1), and
              BS11 (1.6\% cycle?1). Standability, prolificacy, and grain
              moisture also were changed in the desired directions, and, in
              most instances, the responses were linear across cycles of
              selection. Direct responses were greater than indirect responses
              for grain yield and Standability. The selected populations also
              performed better than did the unselected populations in crosses
              with unrelated testers. Changes in inbreeding depression and
              heterosis were associated with selection. Rates of direct and
              indirect responses for grain yield in the inbred populations
              tended to be greater than the rates of responses in the noninbred
              populations. Reciprocal full-sib selection increased the
              frequency of homozygotes for favorable alleles in the BS10 and
              BS11 populations, which would be improved sources of vigorous
              inbred lines with good general combining ability. Reciprocal
              full-sib selection seems to have increased the frequency of
              heterozygotes in the population crosses.",

              with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of
              these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and
              improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate
              knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism
              at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to
              identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a
              sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic
              pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene
              clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to
              conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism.
              Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of
              metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18
              species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an
              intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new
              metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700
              clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized
              metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify
              the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient
              gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed
              clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which
              eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways.
              Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that
              implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single
              gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of

  abstract = "Proteaceae species in south-western Australia occur on severely
              phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils. They have very low leaf P
              concentrations, but relatively fast rates of photosynthesis, thus
              exhibiting extremely high photosynthetic
              phosphorus-use-efficiency (PPUE). Although the mechanisms
              underpinning their high PPUE remain unknown, one possibility is
              that these species may be able to replace phospholipids with
              nonphospholipids during leaf development, without compromising
              photosynthesis. For six Proteaceae species, we measured soil and
              leaf P concentrations and rates of photosynthesis of both young
              expanding and mature leaves. We also assessed the investment in
              galactolipids, sulfolipids and phospholipids in young and mature
              leaves, and compared these results with those on Arabidopsis
              thaliana, grown under both P-sufficient and P-deficient
              conditions. In all Proteaceae species, phospholipid levels
              strongly decreased during leaf development, whereas those of
              galactolipids and sulfolipids strongly increased. Photosynthetic
              rates increased from young to mature leaves. This shows that
              these species extensively replace phospholipids with
              nonphospholipids during leaf development, without compromising
              photosynthesis. A considerably less pronounced shift was observed
              in A. thaliana. Our results clearly show that a low investment in
              phospholipids, relative to nonphospholipids, offers a partial
              explanation for a high photosynthetic rate per unit leaf P in
              Proteaceae adapted to P-impoverished soils.",
